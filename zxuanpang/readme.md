| 4 | Industry Talk 1: PPG | 20 Nov 2025 | By gaining further insights from the talk from PPG, I learned more about how global businesses use analytics, cloud technology, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions, such as SAP, to execute their business operations on a larger scale. I now understand how structured databases through cloud computing platforms or as support to business intelligence will relate to our decision-making processes and how they affect our overall success. Global Marine Hull Navigator shows as an example of how usage of data analytics may provide ocean condition data as well as vessel movement data and how it can help optimize operational efficiencies. In particular, with the predictive analysis through maritime and environmental data analysis, it provides for improved fuel consumption and ultimately ship performance. The information I learned in the session clarified for me real-world use of what I learned regarding SQL, data modelling, and systems integration in class. A demonstration of the actual system from an employee’s perspective or the use of a dashboard with reading it would also assist in clarity about this topic. Overall, this presentation motivated me to further develop my data skills in addition to preparing me to perform in jobs that require having both the technical and analytical abilities necessary to be successful in this 21st century. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ptGkpmhzViGoCnq18yoq2I-_F8WSp3PN?usp=drive_link), [Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11xSmPKnn594dQl1tu4rRnDeV1FT9JcJG/view?usp=sharing) |
| 5 | ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 | 11 Dec 2025 | The ASEAN Quantum Summit provided me with an expanded understanding of next-gen tech, and in particular, quantum computing and its potential to become integrated with AI. I learned that in order for new technologies to progress successfully, it is necessary to have a long-term strategic plan, collaboration between different countries and a strong research ecosystem. I also learned how some of the countries in ASEAN are working collaboratively to develop advanced computing capacity along with building a network of new innovations. One area for improvement would be to simplify some of the technical discussions in a way that would be more understandable to undergraduates.

| 8 | Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype) | 29 Jan 2026 | From the design thinking project, I learned that good system development can only happen if we understand the users' needs and not just be focused on the technical implementation of a system. Even though the prototype for this project is a low-fidelity prototype and did not implement the technical side, developing the prototype in a user-centered design process taught me that knowing who my users are through interviews and surveys help me understand what are their actual needs before proposing a solution. As well, it allowed me to understand how important the system flow and usability, in order to create an engaging and attracting experience for the user. By going through the entire project using user interviews, defining problems, ideation, prototype development, and testing, I gained a greater appreciation for empathy towards others, how to improve in an iterative manner, and how to make decisions based on factual evidence. I was also able to see how a user's comments and suggestions can help create real-life practical solutions. One of the areas I plan to improve upon is to involve more varied groups of users during the testing phase of future projects, so that I can obtain a wider range of opinions about the usability of a proposed design. Overall, this project has made me more aware of user-centric design principles, and has motivated me to create systems that are both technically sound as well as socially impactful. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ui1Mo56DHWqiSjDYR9_sL9lIzPwt0DJB?usp=drive_link), [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_YFnOT37BV1jcpWxZvrPWjp5zCKdJ035/view?usp=sharing), [Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_ncqQm0BeryYV7tvLfSSP84FYNjGwLc/view?usp=sharing) |
