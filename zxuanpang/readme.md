| 4 | Industry Talk 1: PPG | 20 Nov 2025 | Through the industry talk by PPG, I gained deeper insight into how global enterprises utilize data analytics, cloud infrastructure, and ERP systems such as SAP to manage large-scale operations. I understood how structured databases, cloud platforms, and business intelligence tools support decision-making and operational efficiency. The session helped me see the real-world relevance of SQL, data modeling, and system integration concepts learned in class. A live system demonstration or dashboard walkthrough could further enhance understanding. This talk motivated me to strengthen my data-related skills and prepare myself for roles that require both technical and analytical capabilities. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ptGkpmhzViGoCnq18yoq2I-_F8WSp3PN?usp=drive_link), [Poster](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14n1D0KyalbflCure-9yYxkiK2PRcN_VQ?usp=drive_link) |
| 5 | ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 | 11 Dec 2025 | Attending the ASEAN Quantum Summit broadened my knowledge of emerging technologies, particularly quantum computing and its potential integration with artificial intelligence. I learned that technological advancement requires long-term strategic planning, collaboration between nations, and strong research ecosystems. The summit exposed me to regional efforts in developing advanced computing capabilities and innovation networks. One improvement would be simplifying certain technical explanations for undergraduate audiences. Overall, this experience inspired me to stay informed about deep-technology developments and consider how foundational computing knowledge may evolve in the future. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q7twK_YH6poIEsiNBnZxsUVEKalFRi55?usp=drive_link) |
| 6 | Industry Talk 2: Serunai Commerce | 18 Dec 2025 | The talk by Serunai Commerce emphasized the importance of structured development processes and understanding the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I realized that successful systems require careful requirement analysis, planning, architecture design, and continuous evaluation rather than rushing directly into coding. The discussion of Agile and Waterfall methodologies helped me appreciate the need to adapt development strategies based on project context. Including a practical case study would further strengthen understanding. This session reinforced my awareness that technical expertise must be supported by professional discipline, teamwork, and effective communication skills to become industry-ready. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LPHluqmXkDxERgs0W0e2H-CDw5Ku2sY8?usp=drive_link), [Report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-CtHjA4YSeWPHuX2aVqjzNaUQQaVp6EJ?usp=drive_link) |
| 7 | Industry Visit 2: Etiqa Insurance | 15 Jan 2026 | The visit to Etiqa Insurance provided insight into how large-scale integrated information systems operate within the financial and insurance sector. I learned how digital platforms manage policies, claims processing, risk assessment, and customer data while ensuring compliance and security. Observing how data-driven systems support real-time decision-making helped me understand the scale and complexity of enterprise environments.
