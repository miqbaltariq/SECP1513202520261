|   2   |PC Assemble (Lab Activity)     |We learned about the basic hardware parts of a PC, such as the wires, battery, fan, RAM, hard disk, motherboard, and power supply. We then got the chance to dismantle and assemble the PC on our own. This hands-on activity helped us understand how each part works and how they all connect together. It also built our confidence in handling hardware, installing components, and doing simple troubleshooting. This experience created my interest in setting up a PC ourselves can be more practical and cost-saving than relying on a shop. Overall, it was a very helpful and meaningful activity that improved our understanding of PC hardware.|[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A4U1PX2q9KV2TlPWot_VQgzrReXSh3LA?usp=drive_link) |

Dr. Claude Fachkha explained how modern malware, ransomware, and AI-based phishing are becoming smarter and more dangerous. Dr. Lanie B. Laureano highlighted importance of ethical and why we must use AI responsibly, avoid AI errors, and consider sustainability also the need of awareness and education. Ts. Dr. Nur Haliza Abdul Wahab shared how blockchain and AI can help build digital trust and support global goals like the SDGs. Overall, the session helped us understand the importance of using AI safely and ethically in today’s digital world.|[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tlC-b05ErbObiVG9tJSx46tc-6x9FSaY?usp=drive_link)|
|   4   |   Industry Talk by PPG |PPG Industries, a global leader in advanced materials, shared how Data Analytics, Cloud Infrastructure, and SAP drive modern business operations. The speakers explained how data becomes insights, how multi-cloud systems support global services, and how SAP manages core workflows. They also highlighted industry trends like AI Ops and Zero Trust. The session showed how ICT professionals enable digital transformation, offering valuable learning and internship opportunities for students. The connection between the skills and tools, such as SQL, Python, Azure Data Factory, star schema design, and DevOps, in professional environments, impressed me the most. This observation gave me better direction on what I need to focus on in my further studies beyond the formal coursework.Moreover, I learned that SAP modules, including MM, SD, FI, and CO, are not just technical names, but they are fundamental systems that support the global business processes.|[Photos, Poster](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KnxO-dx9gE0_7_YF7ltae-VPVSKGv873?usp=drive_link)|
|   5   | ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025     | Today, I had the privilege of attending the ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 at UTM, with participation from Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, and other ASEAN partners. The event provided valuable insights into the future of quantum technologies, innovation, and regional collaboration. Listening to experts and leaders share their experiences broadened my understanding of how quantum advancements will shape industries and research in the coming years. I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of this meaningful session and to learn from international perspectives. This experience has motivated me to continue exploring emerging technologies and contribute to the growing tech ecosystem in our region. |[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CovuRFaS2mP2I_bsUWpqtMcQxKzZM-lk?usp=drive_link)|
|   6   | Industry Talk by Serunai Commerce   | The industrial talk helped me to understand that computer science is not only successful academically. Besides technical skill, other qualities like teamwork, good communication and flexibility are essential in the industry. The speaker presented practical information about the world that supports the importance of teamwork, practical problem-solving, and constant learning of new technologies. In the next four years, I will work on the projects, code competitions, workshops, and internships to have the practical experience and continue honing these competencies. By doing so, I hope to be able to transfer the classroom learning into the real-world setting, thus, increasing my confidence levels and professional attitude. Through a combination of well-developed technical skills and profession-related soft skills, I hope to be a well-qualified and confident student of computer science as well as make a positive impact on the real-world software development projects.|[Photos, Report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U5fLaYeRpbxSIrOhFurGMhT_FmeclPxH?usp=sharing)|
|   7   |Industry Visit: Etiqa Insurance|We visited Etiqa Insurance, which provides life and motor insurance. The session began with talks from a data engineer, an AI developer, some high-level staff, and a UTM alumni who is working as a web developer. They shared their experiences, highlighting the importance of teamwork and maintaining good relationships with colleagues. They also explained the skills needed to apply for jobs, including technical knowledge, communication, and problem-solving abilities. After the talks, we had a Q&A session to hear real-life experiences from professionals and toured the office, which gave me a better understanding of workplace collaboration. I am grateful to our lecturer for organizing this informative and inspiring visit.|[Photos, Newsletter](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wPRrpYDMnqh6TfAe7dWOWbdSSsjD4k8V?usp=sharing)|
|   8   |Design Thinking Project(Low fidelity Prototype)|Overall, this project helped me to clarify my objectives and have a more accurate idea of how my course prepares me to work in the technology industry. I would like to be a good graduate who has good technical knowledge, particularly in AI-related systems, and can also be capable of designing solutions that can meet the actual needs of users. The design thinking process taught me the value of empathy, problem validation and evidence-based decision making. The emphasis on the accuracy of AI gestures demonstrated to me that technical solutions should be user-centered and reliable to be efficient. In the future, I intend to improve my potential through acquiring more practical experience, improving my technical competence, and never ceasing to learn on the basis of real-life projects and industry experience.|[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hbkJf7R_X5ngyZ6w0ZclZh9bsHLJ4EOb?usp=sharing)<br><br>[Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iHh2rKhsgWosGJJ6MaLsdgpYItJ2nhgn/view?usp=sharing)|
