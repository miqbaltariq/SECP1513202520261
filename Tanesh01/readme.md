|   2   |PC Assemble (Lab Activity)     |We learned about the basic hardware parts of a PC, such as the wires, battery, fan, RAM, hard disk, motherboard, and power supply. We then got the chance to dismantle and assemble the PC on our own. This hands-on activity helped us understand how each part works and how they all connect together. It also built our confidence in handling hardware, installing components, and doing simple troubleshooting. The experience even sparked my interest in building my own PC in the future, since setting up a PC ourselves can be more practical and cost-saving than relying on a shop. Overall, it was a very helpful and meaningful activity that improved our understanding of PC hardware.|                              |
