| Assingment 2   |PC Maintenance (30 October 2025)         |From the PC maintenance, I learned how to disassemble and assemble a PC, and I also learned the parts in the PC, which are the RAM, cables, fan, hard disk, and power supply. Actually, it is not too hard to do that. I gained more confidence to assemble and disassemble the PC properly with the correct steps. From this knowledge, I will be able to build my own PC next time without needing to send it to a shop, which is quite expensive. This is my reflection from my PC maintenance.          |<img width="960" height="1280" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cf8ca09-6ceb-45f1-b89e-3419b1129316" />|
