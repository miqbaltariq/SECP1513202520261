|6|Industry Talk by Serunai Commerce  |The industrial talk by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Muttalib gave me a clearer picture of what it truly means to build a career in computer science.I used to think that strong coding skills and good academic results were enough,but this session made me realize that technical knowledge alone is not sufficient.<br><br>One key insight was that coding is only part of the job.A significant portion of real-world IT work involves system design, planning, communication, and collaboration. Learning about the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) helped me understand how structured phases from planning to maintenance prevent projects from becoming disorganized.The discussion on Waterfall and Agile methodologies also taught me that choosing the right approach depends on the project’s needs, whether it requires clear structure or flexibility.<br><br>I was also inspired by the concept of Agentic Coding, which changed my perspective on AI.Instead of replacing developers, AI can assist us in designing, thinking, and solving problems more effectively when used responsibly.Beyond technical skills, the talk emphasized the importance of teamwork, adaptability, communication, and continuous learning.These qualities are just as important as coding in the industry.Over the next few years,I plan to gain more hands-on experience through projects, competitions, workshops, and internships so I can apply classroom knowledge in real-world settings.<br><br>My goal is not only to graduate with strong technical skills, but also to become a confident, well-rounded computer science student who can contribute meaningfully to real-world projects.|[Pictures & Report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aP2pP4JhmAWEcpIxcdDx54gh_INazHD7?usp=sharing)|
