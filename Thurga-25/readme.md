|1|Industry Visit to UTMDIGITAL |Attending the UTMDigital Open Day was a valuable and meaningful experience for me, and I truly feel lucky to have been given the opportunity to gain exposure to the real IT and digital industry environment. Being able to visit and interact with professionals from various technology companies allowed me to better understand how what we learn in class is applied in the real world. During the visit, I gained many new insights into the role of technology and data in today’s digital world. Mr. SK Leong shared valuable ideas about the importance of artificial intelligence in modern technology, especially how companies like Google widely use AI to enhance efficiency and innovation. This helped me realize how essential AI has become in shaping digital systems and services. I was also particularly inspired by the session presented by Mr. Ronald Chong, an IAS Solution Advisor, who opened my eyes to the fact that Canon is not only involved in camera technology but also plays a significant role in security systems using AI. This broadened my understanding of how traditional technology companies are evolving and adapting AI to meet current industry needs. Additionally, the briefing session by Dr. Ts. Ahmad Sha'rainan Md Shaarani gave me a clearer understanding of the critical role data plays in the IT world. His sharing helped me see how data supports decision-making, system improvement, and digital transformation across industries. This session strengthened my interest in data-driven systems and reinforced the importance of data in my course of study. Overall, the visit provided me with a hands-on learning experience through the various IT-related company booths, where I had the opportunity to ask questions related to my course and future career path. From this visit, I gained better awareness of industry expectations, current technologies, and real-world applications of IT concepts. The experience not only enhanced my knowledge but also motivated me to explore further in the field of technology and information systems.                       |
