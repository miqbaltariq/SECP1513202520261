|1|Industry Visit to UTMDIGITAL |Attending the UTMDigital Open Day was a very important experience for me and I feel extremely fortunate to be able to explore the real-world IT and digital environments that we have learned about in school. Through my ability to speak directly to professionals from different tech-based companies at the event I now better understand how our classroom experiences are utilized within the real world of business.<br><br>I was exposed to a variety of ways that technology and data are used within today's digital world during my visit. Mr. SK Leong explained to us the growing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) in today's technology landscape and how Google utilizes AI in order to improve efficiency and innovation. He showed me just how vital AI will be in creating digital systems and services as it continues to grow and expand.I was also greatly motivated and encouraged after Mr. Ronald Chong presented his session on behalf of Canon, as he clearly demonstrated how Canon does not simply produce camera equipment but also plays a significant role in utilizing AI to create and support security systems. The presentation further expanded my perspective on how traditional technology companies continue to evolve and develop in their uses of AI in response to the demands of the modern digital marketplace.Lastly, I was also able to gain clarity regarding the role of data within the IT world after attending the briefing session by Dr. Ts. Ahmad Sha'rainan Md Shaarani. His explanation of the data and its role in supporting decisions, improving systems and creating digital transformations across all types of businesses made me even more interested in working with data-driven systems and reinforced the significance of data to my studies.<br><br>Overall, the open day provided me with a hands-on way to learn about the different IT-related company booths, which allowed me to ask questions about my coursework and future career goals.The experience not only enhanced my knowledge but also motivated me to explore further in the field of technology and information systems.                      |
