|1|Industry Visit to UTMDIGITAL |Attending the UTMDigital Open Day was a very important experience for me and I feel extremely fortunate to be able to explore the real-world IT and digital environments that we have learned about in school. Through my ability to speak directly to professionals from different tech-based companies at the event I now better understand how our classroom experiences are utilized within the real world of business.<br><br>I was exposed to a variety of ways that technology and data are used within today's digital world during my visit. Mr. SK Leong explained to us the growing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) in today's technology landscape and how Google utilizes AI in order to improve efficiency and innovation. He showed me just how vital AI will be in creating digital systems and services as it continues to grow and expand.I was also greatly motivated and encouraged after Mr. Ronald Chong presented his session on behalf of Canon, as he clearly demonstrated how Canon does not simply produce camera equipment but also plays a significant role in utilizing AI to create and support security systems. The presentation further expanded my perspective on how traditional technology companies continue to evolve and develop in their uses of AI in response to the demands of the modern digital marketplace.Lastly, I was also able to gain clarity regarding the role of data within the IT world after attending the briefing session by Dr. Ts. Ahmad Sha'rainan Md Shaarani. His explanation of the data and its role in supporting decisions, improving systems and creating digital transformations across all types of businesses made me even more interested in working with data-driven systems and reinforced the significance of data to my studies.<br><br>Overall, the open day provided me with a hands-on way to learn about the different IT-related company booths, which allowed me to ask questions about my coursework and future career goals.The experience not only enhanced my knowledge but also motivated me to explore further in the field of technology and information systems.|[Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i7ItTS9BfZq-q9fI6RVKqJcIdTdrW3Et/view?usp=sharing)
|2|PC Assemble(Lab Activity)|This session gave me hands-on experience in PC maintenance where we dismantled all the components of a PC and assembled them back again. With the help of the assistants, I was able to understand the process clearly and safely. We learned about the basic hardware parts of a PC such as the wires, battery, fan, RAM, hard disk, motherboard, and power supply.<br><br>This was a new experience for me and helped me understand how a PC works and what components are inside it. The session also made me realize that I can fix minor PC problems by myself instead of going to a shop and spending money. However, for major problems, it is still better to seek professional help. Overall, the session was informative and increased my confidence in handling basic PC maintenance.    |[Video & Pictures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GpNORQ9ijzXdfzAEOgL1T8ebDGn1afUC?usp=sharing) |
|3|Industry Talk:Online Global Classroom|Attending the Online Global Classroom was a wonderful opportunity to gain knowledge and insights directly from professionals in the field.The session helped me understand how artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, ethics, and digital trust are closely connected in today’s digital world.<br><br>Dr. Claude Fachkha shared valuable insights on how modern cyber threats such as malware, ransomware, and AI-based phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous. Dr. Lanie B. Laureano emphasized the importance of ethics in technology, highlighting why AI must be used responsibly, with awareness of possible errors, sustainability concerns, and the need for continuous education.Ts. Dr. Nur Haliza Abdul Wahab further explained how technologies like blockchain and AI can be used to build digital trust and support global initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).<br><br>For me, this session broadened my perspective on the role of IT in our world and reinforced the importance of using technology safely, ethically, and responsibly as it continues to advance.|[Picture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vceIa0R7_OBqBjVr3_6eyzO9LGz1N6dj/view?usp=sharing)|
|4|Industry Talk by PPG|PPG’s data and analytics strategy was well organized, with four clear pillars: Master Data, ERP Analytics, Data Lake Analytics, and MLOps. Understanding how each pillar plays a different role helped me realize that there are many possible career pathways in this field. The talk answered many questions I had about data and analytics in a real industry setting.<br><br> I was especially surprised to see how tools and skills like SQL, Python, Azure Data Factory, star schema design, and DevOps are connected in real-world jobs. This gave me clearer direction on what I should focus on learning beyond my coursework. I also learned that SAP terms such as MM, SD, FI, and CO are not just acronyms, but core systems that support global business operations.<br><br>Lastly, this visit truly gave me an understanding of my future path. PPG’s team diversity and strong commitment to sustainability and shared values stood out to me. It made me realize that the workplace I want in the future is defined not only by the job role but also by the culture, people, and purpose behind the work.|[Pictures & Poster](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LuthyGjO0LPyogfFLQsYDLf5aBzaTHkz?usp=sharing)|
|5|ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 Opening Ceremony|Today, I had the chance to attend the ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 at UTM, with participants from Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, and other ASEAN partners. The summit was not only about quantum technologies but also about Johor’s vision to grow as a deep-tech hub and support innovation in the region. Listening to experts and policymakers, I gained insights into the practical applications of quantum technologies, from quantum computing to quantum biology, and how they connect to fields like computer science, data engineering, and smart city development. This experience really opened my eyes to the potential of emerging technologies and inspired me to think about how I can contribute to the future tech landscape in our region. I feel grateful for the opportunity to learn from international perspectives and be part of such an inspiring discussion.|[Pictures](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W1JxhMCy9BcaZSqdd1_i8gGce7ZF4nC_?usp=sharing)                       |
|6|Industry Talk by Serunai Commerce  |The industrial talk by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Muttalib gave me a clearer picture of what it truly means to build a career in computer science.I used to think that strong coding skills and good academic results were enough,but this session made me realize that technical knowledge alone is not sufficient.<br><br>One key insight was that coding is only part of the job.A significant portion of real-world IT work involves system design, planning, communication, and collaboration. Learning about the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) helped me understand how structured phases — from planning to maintenance prevent projects from becoming disorganized.The discussion on Waterfall and Agile methodologies also taught me that choosing the right approach depends on the project’s needs, whether it requires clear structure or flexibility.<br><br>I was also inspired by the concept of Agentic Coding, which changed my perspective on AI.Instead of replacing developers, AI can assist us in designing, thinking, and solving problems more effectively when used responsibly.Beyond technical skills, the talk emphasized the importance of teamwork, adaptability, communication, and continuous learning.These qualities are just as important as coding in the industry.Over the next few years,I plan to gain more hands-on experience through projects, competitions, workshops, and internships so I can apply classroom knowledge in real-world settings.<br><br>My goal is not only to graduate with strong technical skills, but also to become a confident, well-rounded computer science student who can contribute meaningfully to real-world projects.|[Pictures & Report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aP2pP4JhmAWEcpIxcdDx54gh_INazHD7?usp=sharing)|
