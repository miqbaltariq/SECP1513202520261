|Assingment 8    |Industry Visit eTiQa Iskandar Puteri(15/1/2026)      |During the visit, we met a Data Engineer, an AI Engineer, and our senior, Hafizul Sharom. The visit began with a background introduction and the sharing of their career journeys. It was an inspiring session. They explained how data engineering supports business operations and the projects they have completed.Later on, we had an interactive Q&A session where we received amazing feedback from their specialists. Having specialists answer our questions opened our eyes to how specialists think and the importance of mindset. They explained how people who are learning to expand their careers are different from those learning just for a job.The topic that I was most interested in was the qualities and skills that they look for when hiring a data engineer. They informed us that to be a data engineer, we need to have a strong foundation (SQL, Python) and fully understand the data engineering role.I am grateful to UTM and Etiqa for organizing this event. The event has improved my understanding of Data Engineering and how it contributes to their company. I have a long journey ahead of me, and this talk has made my journey clear.|       |
