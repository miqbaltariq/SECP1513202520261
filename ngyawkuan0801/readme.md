|Assingment 1|Industry Visit 1   |This visit to UTM Digital Day was a really eye-opening experience, as I learned how AI, data, and digital systems are shaping the future of education and facilities management. The first talk by Mr. Ronald Chong from Canon gave a deep impression on me. He explained how technology can help improve safety and even save lives. He showed us one of Canon’s products, which is a camera that can detect body temperature and monitor a patient’s condition, then give warnings to others if the patient is in danger. This technology is suitable for use in many places, such as hospitals, elderly care homes, and even at home. Overall, this talk helped me realize how digital technology can be applied in real-life situations and how it can bring meaningful impact to society.              |[video](https://lnkd.in/evz95UTq)|
|Assignment 2|PC Assemble|The PC Assemble session helped me recognize the components of a PC, such as the casing, cables, power supply, RAM, and hard disk. We were asked to take out the components one by one while identifying each component. After taking out all the components, we assembled them again and memorized the positions of the PC components. During this process, we discussed in our group and worked together to assemble the PC, which improved our teamwork and communication skills. I am glad that I was able to answer the test given later. This PC assemble session really helped me a lot, as I am not only using a PC, but also understanding and recognizing its internal components. |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Assignment 3|Industry Talk 1|Based on this industry talk by PPG, I now have a better grasp of how significant ICT roles are in assisting actual business operations. I learned how data collection is important in helping a business. For example, in the Global Marine Hull Navigator, data analytics help collect data on sea conditions and ship movement to improve ship efficiency. This demonstrates the importance of skills like SQL, Python, and data visualization in the workplace. The discussion on cloud infrastructure showed how global companies rely on multi-cloud systems and secure architectures to keep their services running smoothly. Overall, I learned that ICT jobs are important because they make sure infrastructure, systems, and data collaborate to support digital transformation. It inspired me to sharpen our technical abilities to adapt to the modern, digital world.|[Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ctxrt8knIMrNN-Y1ddK1cC72KKc8DPob/view?usp=drive_link)|
|Assignment 4|ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025|Lesson I learnt is the need to have a long-term strategic planning in new technology. The discussion with Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa on the quantum roadmap in Japan showed that clearly defined national objectives, industry partnerships, and talent can lead to technological development on a huge scale. In the same vein, a presentation by Mr. Ling Keok Tong emphasized the fact that Singapore is investing not just in the research but also the creation of an ecosystem that will facilitate innovation and international collaborations.The other lesson to me was the rate at which quantum technology is being adopted in ASEAN. In general, this experience encouraged me to keep studying the area of deep-tech and comprehending better how new technologies could transform industries and societies. It also reminded me about the need to remain curious and abreast with the current trends in technology and particularly since I am a student who one day will be ready to work in the technological world.
|Assignment 5|Assignment 3|From the talk by Ts Hj. Abdul Alim, I learned the importance of applying systematic and professional approaches when working on academic and real-world projects. I plan to apply the SDLC by approaching each assignment and project with clear planning, starting from requirement analysis to fully understand the problem before proceeding to system design and development. This approach will help prevent rushed implementation, reduce errors caused by poor planning, and result in higher-quality projects. It also allows me to manage time more effectively and develop solutions in a more structured manner |[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/164oxpKkKJ6B97PZZyNRQO6ob7QXxVlpv/view?usp=drive_link)           |
|Assignment 6|Industry visit 2|One of the key takeaways was the critical role of data engineering and information systems in modern insurance operations. We observed how integrated systems support policy management, claims processing, customer data management, and risk assessment, while maintaining high standards of data security and regulatory compliance. It was fascinating to learn how millions of data transactions can be processed within minutes, highlighting the power and scale of real-world data systems.I also gained a deeper understanding of the skills required in the industry. Beyond technical knowledge such as Python and SQL, professionals emphasized the importance of communication, teamwork, and passion in delivering impactful solutions. The collaboration between IT teams, engineers, and insurance experts showed how technical expertise must align with business needs to create effective digital solutions.|![WhatsApp Image 2026-01-15 at 17 10 46](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/969e1dee-bdbb-45cb-be6f-633165fb16d8)![WhatsApp Image 2026-01-17 at 22 54 20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2f41cae-eea0-45bc-97c4-b0d1394d681c)
