|Assingment 1|Industry Visit 1   |This visit to UTM Digital Day was a really eye-opening experience, as I learned how AI, data, and digital systems are shaping the future of education and facilities management. The first talk by Mr. Ronald Chong from Canon gave a deep impression on me. He explained how technology can help improve safety and even save lives. He showed us one of Canon’s products, which is a camera that can detect body temperature and monitor a patient’s condition, then give warnings to others if the patient is in danger. This technology is suitable for use in many places, such as hospitals, elderly care homes, and even at home. Overall, this talk helped me realize how digital technology can be applied in real-life situations and how it can bring meaningful impact to society.              |video:https://lnkd.in/evz95UTq|
