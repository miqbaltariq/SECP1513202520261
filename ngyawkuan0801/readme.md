|Assingment 1|Industry Visit 1   |This visit to UTM Digital Day was a really eye-opening experience, as I learned how AI, data, and digital systems are shaping the future of education and facilities management. The first talk by Mr. Ronald Chong from Canon gave a deep impression on me. He explained how technology can help improve safety and even save lives. He showed us one of Canon’s products, which is a camera that can detect body temperature and monitor a patient’s condition, then give warnings to others if the patient is in danger. This technology is suitable for use in many places, such as hospitals, elderly care homes, and even at home. Overall, this talk helped me realize how digital technology can be applied in real-life situations and how it can bring meaningful impact to society.              |video:https://lnkd.in/evz95UTq|
|Assignment 2|PC Assemble|The PC Assemble session helped me recognize the components of a PC, such as the casing, cables, power supply, RAM, and hard disk. We were asked to take out the components one by one while identifying each component. After taking out all the components, we assembled them again and memorized the positions of the PC components. During this process, we discussed in our group and worked together to assemble the PC, which improved our teamwork and communication skills. I am glad that I was able to answer the test given later. This PC assemble session really helped me a lot, as I am not only using a PC, but also understanding and recognizing its internal components.
