| 1 | 28/10/2025-29/10/2025 | UTMDIGITAL OPEN DAY| Me and My friends experienced UTMDigital Open Day. It's an event that's meant to showcase technological innovations from other companies and emphasize the role of UTMDigital in bringing it all together.

Our day started with interacting with the many booths that were showcasing their latest innovation. A Canon booth showcased their new smartboard, equipped with many features that facilitate collaboration.

The first session was delivered by SK Leong and Ronald Cheong, who showcased Canon’s latest innovations. One solution that truly stood out to me was their fall-detection AI system. Using camera-based monitoring, it’s already being deployed in hospitals across Singapore to support patients with mobility challenges. It was a powerful reminder that when developing life-saving technologies, we must balance innovation with thoughtful consideration of privacy.

The next talk, delivered by Ion Koay and TS Koay covered how Dell is transforming it's strategy in contemporary tech world. It explained that as consumer and nations adopt to the ubiquitous use of AI, we must remain responsible and vigilant of their possible implications.

The last talk involved a UTMDigital representative detailing the processes involved and the intricacies of UTMDigital in its efforts of providing seamless digital infrastructure. 

Overall, UTMDigital OpenDay was genuinely eye-opening. It broadened my perspective on how companies are navigating the social impact of emerging technologies. It also reinforced my belief that innovations designed to drive economic growth and improve quality of life must be built with a strong sense of responsibility.|
| 2 | 30/10/2025 | PC MAINTENANCE | As part of the Technology Information System course at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), my group and I participated in a hands-on PC Maintenance practical. We disassembled various components of a desktop PC, from opening the case to removing the CPU fan.

The session significantly boosted my confidence in handling, installing, and maintaining PC hardware. It made the whole process feel far less intimidating, and I’m excited to apply these skills when working on my own computer in the future.

Overall, the practical was insightful and engaging. My only wish is that it had been slightly longer, as an extended session would have allowed us to explore the components and troubleshooting procedures in greater detail.

I believe that this knowledge will stay with me for a long time.|
