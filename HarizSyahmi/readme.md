| 1 | 28/10/2025-29/10/2025 | UTMDIGITAL OPEN DAY| Me and My friends experienced UTMDigital Open Day. A Canon booth showcased their new smartboard, equipped with many features that facilitate collaboration. The first session was delivered by SK Leong and Ronald Cheong, who showcased Canon’s latest innovations. One solution that truly stood out to me was their fall-detection AI system. Using camera-based monitoring, it’s already being deployed in hospitals across Singapore to support patients with mobility challenges.  Overall, UTMDigital OpenDay reinforced my belief that innovations designed to drive economic growth and improve quality of life must be built with a strong sense of responsibility.| [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OPPVnQQF_IFxP0K8wWRq-O0_g6kKrFKC?usp=drive_link)  [Assignment Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAjjVExgFEk)|
| 2 | 30/10/2025 | PC MAINTENANCE | My group and I participated in a hands-on PC Maintenance practical. We disassembled various components of a desktop PC, from opening the case to removing the CPU fan. The session significantly boosted my confidence in handling, installing, and maintaining PC hardware. It made the whole process feel far less intimidating. Overall, the practical was insightful and engaging. My only wish is that it had been slightly longer, as an extended session would have allowed us to explore the components and troubleshooting procedures in greater detail. I believe that this knowledge will stay with me for a long time.| [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Svm-G407DpmvPwm_91hpRUNxcZwobqLX?usp=sharing)|
| 3 | 18/11/2025 | Online Global Classroom “Building Trust in Intelligent Systems”.| The classroom showed that technical work in AI must be integrated with governance, ethics, and security across institutions and countries.  It strengthened my understanding of how future data engineering roles will intersect with these areas. I believe future editions could add short hands-on demonstrations or simple labs so participants can engage directly with the subject matter. Overall, This experience made me reflect o how choices in building data infrastructure can either build or weaken public trust in intelligent systems.  It also reinforced the need to keep learning beyond pure coding, especially in responsible innovation and risk management.| [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W8ZCytN3QqSuKTa6mG_b7qas2TdFo-Zb?usp=drive_link)|
| 4 | 20/11/2025 | Industry Talk by PPG | The Talk by PPG emphasized on many aspects of PPG's business and work culture. In this engaging talk, the speaker explained how PPG supplies and maintains the supply chain of paints, and also how the paint is used in areas I haven't thought of, such as surface protection of ships. This talk made me realize PPG's role in nurturing technological leader in the country. I hope more engagement like these, where students and companies actively engage, can happen more frequently. | [Photos and Assignment Poster](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16kU7AUDMLCIlthZYjB93vcSJK4vmW97P?usp=drive_link) |
| 5 | 11/12/2025 | Asean Quantum Summit | I had the privilege to attend the Asean Quantum Summit 2025 at the newly upgraded Dewan Sultan Iskandar at UTM. As the first major ASEAN Quantum event, I was excited to be part of history and engage with the event. The event started with the Chief Minister of Johor’s Speech, then a plenary session by the director of QIQB from the University of Osaka - it ends with a plenary session by a representative from Singapore’s National Quantum Office. During my interaction with the booth, I was introduced to quantum computing, particularly quantum programming environments. These environments allow users to simulate quantum computing on classical computers, avoiding current hardware limitations such as noise, high costs, and complex physical requirements. These platforms are typically cloud-hosted, and I am excited to explore them. Overall, the event made me feel confident in Malaysia’s regional leadership in ASEAN and made me feel proud of my ASEAN identity. I hope to explore Quantum Physics, especially in terms of its applications to computing.| [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13LU1t4HvX9PRkzVEFtL8PLFSlR4zMWzg?usp=drive_link) |
| 6 | 18/12/2025 | Industry Talk by Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd. |For our Technology Information System subject, I had the privilege of attending an industrial talk by Serunai Commerce sdn bhd. The talk detailed on the project management roles within an Information Technology company. The talk made me realize the importance of incorporating project management mindset in my work, especially collaborative assignments. For example, the introduction of “Agile” teamwork method is more appropriate for the ever-changing requirements of a digital product. The talk also emphasised the importance of vigilance in the integration of AI in the daily work of being a student. It has led to a new generation of graduates whom has a weak foundation in their understanding of their job. Overall, the talk was a positive experience - the speaker’s english was professional and engaging. I hope that UTM continues to strengthen these events so that we, as a student - continue to be inspired. | [Photos and Assignment Academic Writing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1etjoA239K_tdF_IHxWCKabm4tIg__zmA?usp=drive_link) |
| 7 | 15/1/2026 | Industry Visit to eTiQa | I am grateful for the opportunity to visit eTiQa and interact with the staff, who shared valuable insights into the technical skills and competencies that the industry prioritizes. The discussion helped me better understand the expectations placed on data and engineering professionals, as well as the practical knowledge required to remain competitive in the field. Learning about the career paths and experiences of the staff, particularly the UTM Data Engineering alumnus Hafizulshah Sharom, clarified my perspective on skill development and long-term career planning. Overall, the visit highlighted the technical rigor and continuous learning mindset needed to build a sustainable career in this industry.| [Photos and Assignment]() |
