|2.   | PC Assemble |<br> I had a hands-on experience on the PC Assemble, where we are required to disassemble a few parts from a fully assembled computer and reassemble it again correctly. This experience had helped me having a better understanding on how and where should each parts of the computer such as the CPU cooler, RAM, storage and power supply unit (PSU) be assembled on. This session had not just strengthened my knowledge learned in the class about hardware, it had also let me know how exactly to work with the computer hardware. Through this activity, I realised that I need to improve my knowledge and familiarity about computer components to work more efficiently and accurately. As a conclusion, this session had enhanced my knowledge and encouraged me to be more proactive in strengthening my technical skills. <br> <br> |[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1y2yhugJbZwW6AijmnTJ8e_Jnm9nxjAzm)|

|8.   | Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype) |<br> The design thinking project made me realise about information technology and information systems as a whole system and not separate parts. It demonstrated the interaction of hardware, software, data, networks and applications to facilitate real life activities to users. Despite the prototype is created as low fidelity design that did not imply technical implementation, the design thinking process allowed me to learn that it is critical to define the actual user needs by interviewing and surveying them and then proposing a solution, and also knowing that system flow, usability, and information presentation, which highlights the importance of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) prior to development was started. Overall, this project enhanced my perception of system design and motivated me to advance my knowledge further in databases, problem-solving, communication and teamwork to better equip me with opportunities in the future in the technology sector. <br> <br>|[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BRRk3lJAeboVzwoiikQ1KYkht2HaAzgt/view?usp=sharing) <br> [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c7s33ArihyRAupLce7Yd1Gl8F6dwhMBX/view?usp=sharing)|
