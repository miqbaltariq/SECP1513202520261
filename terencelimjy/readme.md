|2.   | PC Assemble |<br> I had a hands-on experience on the PC Assemble, where we are required to disassemble a few parts from a fully assembled computer and reassemble it again correctly. This experience had helped me having a better understanding on how and where should each parts of the computer such as the CPU cooler, RAM, storage and power supply unit (PSU) be assembled on. This session had not just strengthened my knowledge learned in the class about hardware, it had also let me know how exactly to work with the computer hardware. Through this activity, I realised that I need to improve my knowledge and familiarity about computer components to work more efficiently and accurately. As a conclusion, this session had enhanced my knowledge and encouraged me to be more proactive in strengthening my technical skills. <br> <br> |[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1y2yhugJbZwW6AijmnTJ8e_Jnm9nxjAzm)|
