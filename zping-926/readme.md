| 3 | 18<sup>th</sup> November 2025 | Online Global Classroom | I attended the Online Global Classroom session to examine the technical intersection of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, ethics, and digital trust in the modern industry. Dr. Claude Fachkha provided insights into the rising sophistication of cyber threats, specifically detailing how AI is being utilized to enhance malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks. The discussion on ethics by Dr. Lanie B. Laureano emphasized the necessity of responsible AI implementation, focusing on the mitigation of system errors and the importance of sustainability in tech development. Furthermore, Ts. Dr. Nur Haliza Abdul Wahab explained the practical applications of blockchain and AI in establishing digital trust and supporting global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This session reinforced that as technology continues to advance, integrating robust security and ethical frameworks into system architecture is as essential as the technology’s core functionality.| [Photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FP368hcCRs2yNFra_olKJbmMWvn9TyIX/view?usp=drive_link)|
| 4 | 20<sup>th</sup> November 2025 | Industry Talk by PPG | I attended an industry talk by PPG on November 20, 2025. The session provided a comprehensive overview of how PPG, a global coatings and materials company, manages its IT infrastructure and digital transformation through SAP S/4HANA. I also gained insights into PPG’s data and analytics ecosystem, including Data Lake Analytics and MLOps for machine-learning automation . Furthermore, the company shared its 2030 sustainability targets, such as a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions . This talk offered a valuable perspective on how technology and environmental responsibility integrate to drive business transformation in a global enterprise.| [Photo & Report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wsbqhVLqF_BsWTgYMYWw57SrO0_6MlrU?usp=drive_link) |
| 5 | 11<sup>th</sup> December 2025 | Asean Quantum Summit |  Attending the ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 held at Dewan Sultan Iskandar, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) on December 11, 2025 was a profound experience that challenged my understanding of classical logic. This high-profile event brought together regional leaders, including the Menteri Besar of Johor and experts from the National Quantum Office of Singapore and the University of Osaka, to discuss the future of quantum technology in the ASEAN region. Attending this summit was a valuable opportunity to move beyond classical logic and explore the complexities of quantum mechanics. It has inspired me to further investigate how quantum advancements will reshape the technological landscape, from cryptography to high-performance computing.| [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1soPjc6WMdTk8tKNFZ0CJZ8xViLRGC3XQ?usp=sharing) |
| 6 | 18<sup>th</sup> December 2025 | Industry Talk by Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd. | Joining the “Project Management and System Development” sharing sessions during a talk by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim bin Abdul Muttalib (Head of Technology and Innovation at Serunai Commerce) on December 18, 2025. The talk was a practical look at what actually matters when moving from university projects to real-world jobs.One of the main takeaways was that being a developer is about much more than just writing code; it’s about mastering the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)—from the initial planning and analysis to long-term maintenance. The speaker also shared a very realistic "Success Formula" for today's landscape: using AI tools for about 40% of our productivity, but keeping 60% of our focus on core system architecture. It was a good reminder that while tools like Cursor.ai can speed things up, we still need a solid understanding of the basics to make the right design decisions.| [Photo & Report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eBjem6WpPHNQ-918I82DKCuLvs2h_Vz8?usp=sharing) |
