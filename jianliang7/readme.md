|Lab|PC Assemble|Through the PC maintenance session, I learned how to properly disassemble and assemble a PC while identifying key components such as the RAM, cables, cooling fan, hard disk, and power supply. The hands-on experience helped me understand how each part functions and connects within the system. I realized that the process is not as difficult as I initially thought. By following the correct steps, I gained confidence in handling the hardware safely and correctly. With this knowledge, I feel more prepared to build or maintain my own PC in the future without relying on a repair shop, which can be costly. | ![pc assemble](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d65745d-6f62-4325-a9ee-52e24b70cc22)|
|Industry Talk|Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom| Reflecting on the session, I realized how important digital trust is in today’s technology-driven world. The discussion on the integration of Blockchain, AI, and Cybersecurity helped me understand that building intelligent systems is not only about innovation, but also about ensuring transparency, security, and ethical responsibility. As these technologies become more embedded in our daily lives, developers and future IT professionals must prioritize trust alongside performance and efficiency.

|Event|ASEAN Quantum Summit|As a student of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, attending the ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 was a meaningful and eye-opening experience. The event began with an inspiring officiation ceremony led by our Vice-Chancellor together with the Chief Minister of Johor, reflecting the strong commitment from both the university and state leadership toward advancing quantum initiatives. One of the highlights of the summit was the plenary sessions delivered by Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa from the University of Osaka and Mr. Ling Keok Tong from Singapore’s National Quantum Office. Their presentations shed light on the rapid development of quantum technologies worldwide and emphasized the urgency for ASEAN nations to enhance collaboration in order to remain competitive in this transformative field. Beyond the technical discussions, the summit conveyed a broader message: progress in quantum innovation relies not only on expertise, but also on strategic partnerships and collective effort. The experience has inspired me to further strengthen my knowledge and actively contribute to the growing quantum ecosystem within our region. | ![asean quantum](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c06ad92e-2c5b-4621-bd03-53f84637e75e)|
|Assignment 3|Industry Talk by Serunai Commerse Sdn Bhd|Through the session delivered by Ts Hj. Abdul Alim, I gained a deeper understanding of the value of adopting a systematic and professional mindset in both academic tasks and real-world projects. His insights highlighted the importance of following a structured process rather than rushing straight into development.Moving forward, I intend to implement the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in my assignments and projects. This means beginning with proper requirement analysis to clearly identify and understand the problem before progressing to system design and development. By following this structured approach, I can avoid hasty implementation, minimize errors due to insufficient planning, and ultimately produce higher-quality outcomes. Additionally, applying SDLC will help me manage my time more efficiently and build solutions in a more organized and methodical way. | ![industry talk 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71b76a22-9c57-48f8-8ec5-1561095771bc)|
