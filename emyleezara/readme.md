| 1 | PC MAINTENANCE |Seeing the insides of a CPU right infront of my eyes for the felt alien to me. Going from just reading materials on the maintainence of a computer to physically doing it on my own was a challenging yet rewarding expereince. Beyond the assembly, the biggest lesson came from the tangled wires. I realized that building a high-performance machine isn't enough, it must also be sustainable and maintainable. Successfully troubleshooting cable connections taught me to think like an engineer, turning a frustrating challenge into a detective game. This experience has transformed me from a mere user into someone who is deeply curious about the inner workings of every machine. | |
| 2 | Visit to UTM Digital | My visit to UTM Digital was a turning point in how I view my course. Initially, concepts like "AI" and "Digital Transformation" felt abstract, but seeing real-world applications like Mr. Ronald Chong's (Canon) insights on imaging data and Mr. SK Leong's talk on AI privacy monitoring made the technology feel clear. <br><br> The most impactful lesson came from Dr. Ts. Ahmad Sha'rainan Md Shaarani, who introduced me to "process-centric thinking." I realized without real-time data flow, even a "Digital Twin" is just a concept. This experience shifted my perspective: true innovation isn't just about the software, it's about understanding the frameworks, collaborators, and diverse mindsets behind the code. | |
| 3 | PPG Industry Talk | The industry talk by PPG was an eye-opening experience that transformed my perspective on how ICT roles drive global business. I finally saw how the tools I learn in class, like SQL and Python, are not isolated subjects but are powerful when integrated with Azure Data Factory, DevOps, and Star Schema design. This clarity has motivated me to look beyond my coursework and focus on how these technologies combine in a professional environment. I learned how a global organization organizes its technical strategy into four groups which are Master Data, ERP Analytics, Data Lake Analytics, and MLOps.  The session also introduced me to the Plan-Build-Run model for cloud management and the evolution toward AI-driven IT operations and Edge Computing. This talk shifted my focus from just "job titles" to the importance of workplace culture, purpose, and values, specifically PPG's alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Seeing the diversity within their team and their clear values helped me realize the kind of environment I want to grow in, where one where people and purpose are prioritized alongside innovation. | |
| 4 | Industry Talk 1 |The Global Classroom session sparked a big shift in perspective, moving the focus from purely technical innovation to the need for "wise" rather than just "smart" systems. The discussions highlighted a contradiction where while AI is a powerful tool for efficiency and cybersecurity, it is also a mirror of human flaw, capable of amplifying biases, as seen in Amazon’s discriminatory recruiting AI and eroding trust through deepfakes and lack of transparency. By integrating Dr. Fachkha’s warnings on algorithmic bias with Dr. Laureano’s focus on responsible AI frameworks, it becomes clear that technical excellence must be balanced with human oversight, environmental consciousness, and the security of tools like blockchain. Ultimately, the session emphasized that for technology to be truly successful, it must be built with a conscience and an ethical foundation that prioritizes the well-being of the people it serves. | |
| 5 | ASEAN Quantum Summit | The ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 served as a powerful catalyst for reimagining the future of regional innovation, shifting the focus from theoretical science to the practical necessity of "quantum literacy." By combining the scientific depth of Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa’s insights on ultra-secure communication with Mr. Ling Keok Tong’s systemic view on infrastructure, it is evident that quantum progress requires a comprehensive ecosystem rather than isolated research. Other than that, the takeaways highlight a transition in thinking: we are moving beyond traditional binary computing toward hybrid models where Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology works alongside classical systems to solve complex global challenges.
This shift demands a shift in education as well, moving from passive listening to getting our hands dirty through tools like Qiskit and interactive simulations. Ultimately, the summit highloghted that for ASEAN to lead in this space, there must be a seamless collaboration between government policy, infrastructure development, and a talent pipeline that is not only scientifically fluent but also capable of navigating the ethical and practical frameworks of this new computing era.| |
| 6 | Industry Talk 2 |The industry talk by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim bin Abdul Muttalib provided a essential reality check, shifting the perspective of IT work from a narrow focus on coding to a broader understanding of broad system design and project management. The core takeaway was that coding represents only a small percentage of a project, while the remaining percent consist of planning, analysis, and maintenance, which serves as the structural foundation that prevents development from descending into chaos. By mastering the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and strategically balancing the structured milestones of the Waterfall methodology with the adaptive flexibility of Agile, students can move beyond being "coders" to becoming thoughtful architects of technology.
Furthermore, the introduction of "Agentic Coding" redefined the role of AI as a high-level collaborator rather than a replacement, allowing developers to focus on complex problem-solving and creative design. This session motivated a transition toward a "project thinking" mindset, where assignments are treated as blueprints requiring collaboration, rigorous testing, and continuous reflection. Ultimately, the talk emphasized that success in the industry depends on starting this journey of serious exploration and disciplined management from day one to ensure that, upon graduation, one can step into real-world settings as a reliable and effective collaborator. | |
