| 2 | Visit to UTM Digital | My visit to UTM Digital was a turning point in how I view my course. Initially, concepts like "AI" and "Digital Transformation" felt abstract, but seeing real-world applications—like Mr. Ronald Chong's (Canon) insights on imaging data and Mr. SK Leong's talk on AI privacy monitoring—made the technology feel clear. <br><br> The most impactful lesson came from Dr. Ts. Ahmad Sha'rainan Md Shaarani, who introduced me to "process-centric thinking." I realized without real-time data flow, even a "Digital Twin" is just a concept. This experience shifted my perspective: true innovation isn't just about the software, it's about understanding the frameworks, collaborators, and diverse mindsets behind the code. | |
