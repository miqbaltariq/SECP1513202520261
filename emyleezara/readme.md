| 1 | PC MAINTENANCE | 30/10 (assessment through quiz) | Seeing the insides of a CPU right infront of my eyes for the felt alien to me. Going from just reading materials on the maintainence of a computer to physically doing it on my own was a challenging yet rewarding expereince. Beyond the assembly, the biggest lesson came from the tangled wires. I realized that building a high-performance machine isn't enough, it must also be sustainable and maintainable. Successfully troubleshooting cable connections taught me to think like an engineer, turning a frustrating challenge into a detective game. This experience has transformed me from a mere user into someone who is deeply curious about the inner workings of every machine. |
| 2 | Visit to UTM Digital | My visit to UTM Digital was a turning point in how I view my course. Initially, concepts like "AI" and "Digital Transformation" felt abstract, but seeing real-world applications like Mr. Ronald Chong's (Canon) insights on imaging data and Mr. SK Leong's talk on AI privacy monitoring made the technology feel clear. <br><br> The most impactful lesson came from Dr. Ts. Ahmad Sha'rainan Md Shaarani, who introduced me to "process-centric thinking." I realized without real-time data flow, even a "Digital Twin" is just a concept. This experience shifted my perspective: true innovation isn't just about the software, it's about understanding the frameworks, collaborators, and diverse mindsets behind the code. | |
