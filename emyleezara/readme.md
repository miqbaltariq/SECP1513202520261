| 1 | PC MAINTENANCE |Seeing the insides of a CPU right infront of my eyes for the felt alien to me. Going from just reading materials on the maintainence of a computer to physically doing it on my own was a challenging yet rewarding expereince. Beyond the assembly, the biggest lesson came from the tangled wires. I realized that building a high-performance machine isn't enough, it must also be sustainable and maintainable. Successfully troubleshooting cable connections taught me to think like an engineer, turning a frustrating challenge into a detective game. This experience has transformed me from a mere user into someone who is deeply curious about the inner workings of every machine. | ![WhatsApp Image 2026-02-13 at 03 16 17 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f45d1396-5ca5-4f23-bf2f-4bd251a7ea35) |
| 2 | Visit to UTM Digital | My visit to UTM Digital was a turning point in how I view my course. Initially, concepts like "AI" and "Digital Transformation" felt abstract, but seeing real-world applications like Mr. Ronald Chong's (Canon) insights on imaging data and Mr. SK Leong's talk on AI privacy monitoring made the technology feel clear. <br><br> The most impactful lesson came from Dr. Ts. Ahmad Sha'rainan Md Shaarani, who introduced me to "process-centric thinking." I realized without real-time data flow, even a "Digital Twin" is just a concept. This experience shifted my perspective: true innovation isn't just about the software, it's about understanding the frameworks, collaborators, and diverse mindsets behind the code. |![WhatsApp Image 2026-02-13 at 03 16 17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebfe126b-bf31-4d8d-b984-c18c6658854d) |
| 3 | PPG Industry Talk | The industry talk by PPG was an eye-opening experience that transformed my perspective on how ICT roles drive global business. I finally saw how the tools I learn in class, like SQL and Python, are not isolated subjects but are powerful when integrated with Azure Data Factory, DevOps, and Star Schema design. This clarity has motivated me to look beyond my coursework and focus on how these technologies combine in a professional environment. I learned how a global organization organizes its technical strategy into four groups which are Master Data, ERP Analytics, Data Lake Analytics, and MLOps.  The session also introduced me to the Plan-Build-Run model for cloud management and the evolution toward AI-driven IT operations and Edge Computing. This talk shifted my focus from just "job titles" to the importance of workplace culture, purpose, and values, specifically PPG's alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Seeing the diversity within their team and their clear values helped me realize the kind of environment I want to grow in, where one where people and purpose are prioritized alongside innovation. |![WhatsApp Image 2026-02-13 at 03 16 17 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/036888cf-8f00-48a7-8016-785c79fd2b3f) |
| 4 | Industry Talk 1 |The Global Classroom session sparked a big shift in perspective, moving the focus from purely technical innovation to the need for "wise" rather than just "smart" systems. The discussions highlighted a contradiction where while AI is a powerful tool for efficiency and cybersecurity, it is also a mirror of human flaw, capable of amplifying biases, as seen in Amazon’s discriminatory recruiting AI and eroding trust through deepfakes and lack of transparency. By integrating Dr. Fachkha’s warnings on algorithmic bias with Dr. Laureano’s focus on responsible AI frameworks, it becomes clear that technical excellence must be balanced with human oversight, environmental consciousness, and the security of tools like blockchain. Ultimately, the session emphasized that for technology to be truly successful, it must be built with a conscience and an ethical foundation that prioritizes the well-being of the people it serves. | |
| 5 | ASEAN Quantum Summit | The ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 served as a powerful catalyst for reimagining the future of regional innovation, shifting the focus from theoretical science to the practical necessity of "quantum literacy." By combining the scientific depth of Prof. Dr. Masahiro Kitagawa’s insights on ultra-secure communication with Mr. Ling Keok Tong’s systemic view on infrastructure, it is evident that quantum progress requires a comprehensive ecosystem rather than isolated research. Other than that, the takeaways highlight a transition in thinking: we are moving beyond traditional binary computing toward hybrid models where Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology works alongside classical systems to solve complex global challenges. This shift demands a shift in education as well, moving from passive listening to getting our hands dirty through tools like Qiskit and interactive simulations. Ultimately, the summit highloghted that for ASEAN to lead in this space, there must be a seamless collaboration between government policy, infrastructure development, and a talent pipeline that is not only scientifically fluent but also capable of navigating the ethical and practical frameworks of this new computing era.|![WhatsApp Image 2026-02-13 at 03 16 18 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef8b314-061e-4763-bc45-7c28f6b8ea8a)  ![WhatsApp Image 2026-02-13 at 03 16 18 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d4f8edd-6880-41f6-92be-238c78694bd8) |
| 6 | Industry Talk 2 |Upon participating in the industry talk by Ts. Hj Abdul Alim BinAbdul Muttalib I realized how Agentic Coding will redefine our work performance. I would also transition from the Waterfall method to the Agile method in group assignment settings as it would allow me to manage team synergy while staying adaptable to changing requirements in the long run.|![WhatsApp Image 2026-02-13 at 03 16 18 6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d1518a5-9c4f-4ed4-8a34-d0f4808be4c0) |
| 7 | Industry Visit to Etiqa Insurance |The industry visit to Etiqa served as a bridge between classroom theory and real-world impact, revealing that data engineering is not just about technical proficiency but about serving the human behind the data point. While the visit highlighted the necessity of mastering core tools like SQL and professional networking, it also showcased the sophisticated application of AI and database technology in the insurance sector—specifically how automated image validation can expedite claims for disaster victims. This realization shifted the perspective of the field from a technical subject to a social mission, where understanding diversed consumer behaviors allows for more empathetic and effective decision-making. Witnessing Etiqa’s commitment to work-life balance and their use of data as a proactive asset for the "greater good" provided a clear sense of purpose for future career development. The experience emphasized that behind every database and security measure lies a responsibility to protect and assist people during their most vulnerable moments. Ultimately, the visit motivated a more disciplined approach to learning, with the goal of not just competing in a high-pressure industry, but using technical expertise to build systems that are both reliable and deeply impactful for society.|![WhatsApp Image 2026-02-13 at 03 16 19 7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5fe1979-410b-4737-9bf3-7465800ce2cd) |
| 8 | Design Thinking Project |Participating in the development of PayFit has fundamentally changed my understanding of digital solutions to real world problems. From the different phases of developing this project, I gained many new insights, one of them being the financial stress as a barrier to athletic success among students. I learned that for a solution to be truly effective, it must address the correlation of the user's lifestyle and their specific constraints. Which in this case, the problem being to balance someone's passion for sports with a limited budget. One of the most of the significant challenges we faced during this project was the ideation phase. Our group members proposed a wide variety of ideas, and narrowing them down into a single, cohesive prototype requires critical thinking. I learned that the "Design Thinking" process is not linear, but rather needs constant refinement. This experience has improved my ability to evaluate ideas not just based on their complexity, but also based on their practicality and impact on users. All in all, the skills I have acquired, specifically empathy mapping will be invaluable to my future career. I now understand that before building a product, one must build a deep understanding of the target user.|![WhatsApp Image 2026-02-13 at 03 30 56 8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31dcba07-b18e-4391-a512-37219505225f)
