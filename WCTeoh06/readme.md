|Assignment 1 |Industry Visit to UTM Digital           |Participating in the UTM Digital Open Day was a great opportunity to explore the broader landscape of digital technology beyond the classroom. It provided a platform to see how theoretical concepts are applied in real-world scenarios and industry innovations.                    |[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s0RRithnbbLiVACNwcgM6sORH4SIwojk?usp=sharing)                       |
|Assignment 2 |PC Assemble (Lab Activity)              |The hands-on PC Maintenance workshop was a great way to connect what I learned about computer architecture in theory with how to use it in real life. Lecturer gave me the basic ideas I needed, but working with the hardware made me appreciate the engineering behind our everyday machines even more.                        |[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Yq4e416xoUCQ7cPoWMx9Joj-jQzl4E9A?usp=drive_link)                      |
|Assignment 3 |Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom  |Attending the Online Global Classroom on "Building Trust in Intelligent Systems" was a great way to learn about the moral and security issues that come up in today's tech world. The partnership between UTM, the University of Dubai, and Davao Oriental State University gave us a wide range of international views on how different parts of the world are getting ready for the future of AI.                    |[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12WLjvomNAkQrMLVAOxbzPs9_zSbHPMAy?usp=sharing)                       |
|Assignment 4 |Industry Talk by PPG                    |Taking part in the session with PPG Industries was a turning point for me because it helped me connect what I learned in school to what businesses need in the real world. PPG is a world leader in manufacturing and technology, and it showed how data engineering can make things more efficient and innovative on a large scale.                    |[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TeRhjwVldgMFi9WSFiGCMP7uVb6ycvOF?usp=drive_link)                       |
|Assignment 5 |ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025               |Attending the ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 event was an eye-opening experience that expanded my perspective from a local to a regional level. The event brought together experts and delegates to discuss the future of technology—specifically regarding Quantum Computing and Big Data—within the Southeast Asian landscape.                    |[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14kCZyMiQ9I3b2gmIN8lbCjKYQ2STdfmR?usp=drive_link)                       |
|Assignment 6 |Industry Talk by Serunai Commerse       |The Senurai event served as a valuable platform for critical inquiry, encouraging me to look beyond standard curriculum solutions and question the underlying "why" of complex technical problems. Engaging in this focused dialogue honed my ability to synthesize information in real-time and challenged me to approach obstacles with a multi-faceted perspective. It was a refreshing reminder that true expertise requires active engagement and the willingness to explore specialized streams of knowledge beyond the textbook.                    |[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UKhFofQc2y5mUx0HIPMeOpTS3oVMpnCn?usp=sharing)                       |
|Assignment 7 |Design Thinking (Low fidelity Prototype)|Prototyping PlayMatch taught me that critical thinking is about constantly asking "why" instead of just "how." I learned to look past my first exciting ideas and realistically ask if they actually solved the user's problem of finding a sports partner. Instead of just making the app look nice, I had to use logic to spot holes in the matchmaking process and make tough choices to cut features that were just clutter. This experience showed me that real design isn't about adding more buttons, but about thinking deeply to find the simplest way to make the app work for the user.                             |[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UGGmWpaYNyNWcLtwBs82_CYwXZlGXgSv?usp=sharing)                           |                         
|Assignment 8 |Industry Visit to Etiqa Insurance       |My visit to Etiqa Insurance gave me a clear understanding of a Data Engineer's career path. By listening to the team explain their daily tasks, I realized that the job is about much more than just coding; it is about taking ownership of data to ensure it is accurate and ready for the business to use. They described how industry challenges are different from university assignments, especially regarding the scale and speed of data. This session clarified exactly what responsibilities I will face in the future and what I need to prepare myself for now.                                 |[Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12ASA_VEltjH1wreE1vEDZmo9duy63qSa?usp=drive_link)    |
