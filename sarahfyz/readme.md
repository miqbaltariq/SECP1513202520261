| 1 | UTMDIGITAL OPEN DAY | I attended the UTMDigital Open Day with my friends, where we explored various technology showcases. One memorable highlight was the Canon booth, which featured an advanced smartboard designed to enhance teamwork and collaboration. The session by SK Leong and Ronald Cheong introduced Canon’s latest innovations, including a camera-based fall-detection AI system already implemented in hospitals in Singapore. This experience strengthened my view that impactful technological innovation should not only focus on advancement, but also on ethical responsibility and improving quality of life. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ifx8rnHAuFMfi7IQb52KnPOdf78hJQ6d?usp=drive_link) |
| 2 | PC MAINTENANCE | I took part in a hands-on PC maintenance practical with my group, where we dismantled and examined different desktop components such as the casing and CPU fan. The session helped me become more comfortable and confident when handling hardware parts. Tasks that once felt complex became more manageable through direct experience. I found the session very beneficial and believe the skills gained will be useful in the long run, though a longer duration would have allowed deeper exploration of troubleshooting techniques. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y09CIG89FdfunuyNKqR7MEGlV4Q86HXn?usp=drive_link) |
| 3 | Online Global Classroom: “Building Trust in Intelligent Systems” | This global classroom session highlighted that AI development is not only a technical challenge but also closely tied to ethics, governance, and security on a global scale. It helped me understand how future roles in data engineering must consider trust and accountability when designing systems. The session encouraged me to think critically about how data infrastructure decisions influence public confidence. I believe future sessions could be further enhanced by including simple practical demonstrations to reinforce these concepts. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X_9B2n-yZYpF0UpUS4aXJ-eoZrJMvFtV?usp=drive_link) |
| 4 | Industry Talk by PPG | The industry talk by PPG provided insights into the company’s operations, work culture, and supply chain management. I was particularly interested in learning how PPG’s paint solutions are used beyond common applications, such as protecting ship surfaces. The talk broadened my understanding of how industrial technology contributes to national development. It also emphasized the importance of strong collaboration between industry and students, and I hope similar engagement sessions can be organized more frequently. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19FUUlEjuVGbGQVutbGvQzmfMBJO7vuAB?usp=drive_link) |
| 5 | ASEAN Quantum Summit | I had the opportunity to attend the ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 at Dewan Sultan Iskandar, UTM. As the first major quantum-related event in ASEAN, it was inspiring to witness discussions led by international experts, including representatives from Japan and Singapore. Through booth interactions, I was introduced to quantum computing platforms that simulate quantum environments on classical computers via the cloud. This exposure sparked my interest in exploring quantum computing further and reinforced my pride in Malaysia’s role within the ASEAN technology landscape. | [Photos](./evidence/global_classroom/(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MBGcBfwSoJQWuOpZ2xDFmyTzvczB0-1n?usp=drive_link)) |
| 6 | Industry Talk by Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd. | During this industrial talk, I gained valuable insights into project management roles within an IT company. The speaker emphasized the importance of adopting structured management approaches, such as Agile methodology, especially in collaborative and fast-changing digital projects. The session also raised awareness about the risks of over-reliance on AI without strong foundational understanding. Overall, the talk was informative and engaging, and it motivated me to apply better teamwork and project planning strategies in my academic work. | [Photos](./evidence/serunai_industry_talk/) |
| 7 | Industry Visit to eTiQa | The visit to eTiQa provided a clearer picture of the skills and competencies expected from data and engineering professionals in the industry. Interacting with the staff helped me understand real-world technical demands and career expectations. Hearing the journey of a UTM Data Engineering alumnus was particularly motivating and helped shape my perspective on long-term career development. The visit reinforced the importance of continuous learning and technical adaptability in building a sustainable career. | [Photos](./evidence/etiqa_industry_visit/) | .
| 8 | Project (Design Thinking) | Through this assignment, I engaged with the complete process of requirements engineering from eliciting public needs to conducting a comparative analysis of existing market solutions. These insights were directly applied to the creation of our prototype, ensuring the design was grounded in evidence and user utility. Furthermore, the project served as a practical exercise in team dynamics, reinforcing the necessity of clear communication and coordinated effort. I view this conceptual prototype as a strong foundation and look forward to the technical challenge of implementing and deploying a live version. | [Photos](./evidence/etiqa_industry_visit/) | .
