| Assignment 2 | Industry Visit to UTM Digital | We learned how technologies are applied in various industries to improve efficiency, reduce human errors and save lives. These includes innovations such as Google's EDLA certifications, Canon's PTZ camera, Dell's AI-integrated laptop and more. These innovations are the example of how the advancement of the latest technology ensure our life quality and our productivity by managing simple tasks and let us focus more on complex situations. Overall, this visit was fruitful and eye-opening, motivates us to never keep learning, improving and adapt to the rapid development of technologies. | [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/PAjjVExgFEk) [Photos and Videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MkC_8eyhBTdmCVXBnfTRZOzU1h8j47Iu?usp=drive_link) |
| Lab | PC Assemble (Lab Activity) | We learnt the hardware components in a PC, including wires, battery, fan, RAM, and hard disk. We then tried on ourselves to assemble and dissemble the PC on our own. It sparks my interesting in building my own PC according to my needs in the future. Setting up our own PC can often be more cost-effective and practical than relying on a shop, unless professional help is absolutely necessary. Learning these skills empowers us to troubleshoot, customize, and truly understand the technology we depend on. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K_9GCVUUudDvIs3NIuFGp0OgYhsZbeFZ?usp=drive_link) |
| Industry Talk | Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom | Artificial Intelligence (AI) is applied across industries around the world.

Therefore, it is crucial for authorities to capture the misuse of AI in cyber-related crimes, stick to the guidelines in AI development, and use AI ethically in matters that benefit society. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G0BAIoqVAlgI6LIoLPYMJLeY3M6cUs85?usp=drive_link) |
| Event | ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 | From the talk by several big figures, it is mentioned that, along with A.I., quantum technology is also developing rapidly. Hence, countries from ASEAN had put initiatives to advance in Quantum Technology. Through this summit, quantum theory was taught, and MOU was exchanged. Speech was given to encourage young people to innovate, explore, and adapt in the quantum industries. Quantum, a topic once seemed far away, now is within our hands. We should utilize and integrate it into technologies to unveil its capabilities and benefit the people. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_X5VF3WkNhm3PsmsTq6ZWO3BgcmPUzEA?usp=drive_link) |
| Assignment 3 | Industry Talk by Serunai Commerse | Through this talk, I have learnt that it is crucial for us as developers to master project management. Through project management, we may effectively organize our project and prevent chaos in task distribution, ensures the smoothness of the progress. Furthermore, AI agents are excellent development aid. Therefore, we can be the "system architect" and manage the AI team that builds the system, with the premise that we already comprehend the concepts involved in the coding, making any debugging procedures easier. | [Academic Writing, Photos and Slides Screenshots](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HVXnSmceVwekIGrqB3NFDzu_cpyy-dPa?usp=drive_link) |
| Assignment 4 | Industry Visit to Etiqa | Through this industry visit, I gained a deeper understanding of the roles of data analysts, data engineers, and business anlaysts, as well as how they collaborate with one another. It truly opened my eyes as I learn about the real-world use case of AI. For example, Etiqa's AI system detects flood areas, detecting the clients in need through AI profiling, and auto-credit insurance claims to the Selangor's flood victim's account. This is a scenario that feels close and relevant to me. I also learned that technical skills such as mastering SQL and Python are essential, but they are far more impactful when paired with strong communication skills. This combination enables professionals to translate complex data insights into clear, actionable outcomes, ultimately leading to better decision-making and more meaningful results. | [Newsletter and Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c_INauTTik-vxyEqlvkjOIgZqM9s-65w?usp=drive_link) |
