| Assignment 2 | PC Assemble (Lab Activity) | We learnt the hardware components in a PC, including wires, battery, fan, RAM, and hard disk. We then tried on ourselves to assemble and dissemble the PC on our own. It sparks my interesting in building my own PC according to my needs in the future. Setting up our own PC can often be more cost-effective and practical than relying on a shop, unless professional help is absolutely necessary. Learning these skills empowers us to troubleshoot, customize, and truly understand the technology we depend on. | [Photos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K_9GCVUUudDvIs3NIuFGp0OgYhsZbeFZ?usp=drive_link) |
