|Assignment 2|Industry Visit to UTM Digital|The first talk by Ronald Chong from Canon showed how AI is actually integrating into our physical world. They are using AI for things that genuinely help people, like fall prevention in elderly care and monitoring safety compliance in warehouses to prevent accidents with forklifts. Overall, it was a great mix of seeing the current technology and AI integrating into our daily lives at home, university and at workplace and understanding the serious management needed to make it work.|![image alt](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGgHlIuFreOBA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZtBcIr1KkAw-/0/1766329454356?e=1772064000&v=beta&t=U2X0mCyXZB_ahXO202KmWqwHFUAFSdF2eokUqqvv-hg) ![image alt](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFI2jZi3uJpSg/feedshare-shrink_1280/B4EZtBcIsMIMAs-/0/1766329454379?e=1772064000&v=beta&t=zbdz9aF6trcd1Eoj-HxGKluoKkpBo6aQQSpW9v-lssw)|
|Lab|PC Assemble|We learnt the basic hardware parts of PC, including wires, RAM, fan, battery and hard disks, and how to both install and uninstall them. This raises my interest in building a PC in the future using my own hands which could save money while acting as an extra skillset for me at the same time.|![image alt](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQGyTVrcM4w2bw/feedshare-shrink_1280/B4EZtDcZNwIQAs-/0/1766363076517?e=1772064000&v=beta&t=KI3EDpG6rWLMcJtrZiDedX3vDrot5NNRWGadYp75phA)|
|Industry Talk|Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom| AI is increasingly being used by both defenders and attackers in cybersecurity, turning it into a continuous battle. Human expertise will always remain essential even though AI exists to strengthen the security, especially when it comes to complex reasoning, critical decision-making, and safeguarding against emerging threats.|![image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQHhASzQk8eXMg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZtDg5mXHEA0-/0/1766364265275?e=1772064000&v=beta&t=vXTijbvmsccDeVFD6yLLf2wXx3qfubh2ISmvG3WBacE)|
|Event|ASEAN Quantum Summit|From the talks of a couple of big figures, I learnt that quantum technology is being rapidly endorsed and adopted in ASEAN region. Dr Masahiro Kitagawa discusses quantum roadmap in Japan and how advancement of quantum technology can happen in a huge scale. Mr Ling Keok Tong of Executive Director of National Quantum Office from Singapore also discusses something similar but in building ecosystem.|![photo](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQE9dvSiWYOmpA/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZxSd.FFJMAg-/0/1770910114967?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=NhLkAnSEy11KDj2Xu4sSTItnZl-C88uprdKVj7HOMek)![photo](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHVGabj-KWIuA/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZxSd9IuH8Ag-/0/1770910110468?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=imlvs48E5YpDv-U_iuOoa6yXmrkRoXDP_QHsB7sArHA)|
|Assignment 3|Industry Talk by Serunai Commerse Sdn Bhd|The talk showed me the importance of Project Management and the difference between its methodologies, which are Waterfall and Agile. Most importantly, it made me realise that I should enhance my knowledge in coding and project management to not fully rely on AI and be ready for employment.|![Photo](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHItqEmKAs70A/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZxSge1kH8Ag-/0/1770910772795?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=Unq3W2_0ohK9G3YTDg4NdWXfktja0J4VNLlaks4JIRc) ![photo](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQF_uSnWClftUw/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZxSghGpIAAo-/0/1770910782160?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=ocfsxH-oVcaR7nz89mAvk287rp_vA_I8GfehMlpe934)|
|Assignment 4|Industry Visit to Etiqa|This industrial visit at Etiqa has given me deeper insights on how Information Systems are applied to real-world corporations. As a student of Data Engineering course, witnessing how a leading Insurance and Takaful company manages extensive datasets and complex system highlighted the importance of industry exposure. This visit opened my eyes on how computer field employees work in a company that operates business that is not mainly related to computer science works and the environment of a workplace. I also gained how AI is used and applied by the company without actually replacing the employees and enhance the business flow.|![photo](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHpZVKxfx9Dlw/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZxSlmadLIAk-/0/1770912114848?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=dbfiCVroXrg_Bo1ThOLxzMSMCeb3mpSk_VZLPjKb73k) ![photo2](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQE_zZjCQA6Oyw/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZxSlkjgJ0Ak-/0/1770912107120?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=iieOiqXA2h6CvM09s7-XNwrbXqdR9ZgmAilv9KB-yoQ) ![photo3](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQF5AjaiW8da-g/feedshare-shrink_800/B56Zv_J9jgJcAk-/0/1769512360349?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=eTPvabGEBScHxY_fxb60Pfy-07pODsL7Qt3p_e6UScQ)
|Project|Design Thinking (Low fidelity Prototype)|The process of the development of PayFit is quite a new understanding for me regarding the process of design thinking and managing a project within a small group. My primary focus on this project was to serve as a bridge between understanding our users and building the final prototype. We were initially overwhelmed by the range of problems faced by the athletes but I learned the importance of convergence and filter through the noise and find the root cause, which is the lack of good financial management in our case. The collaboration of ideas from different members has been the most challenging part for me: I had to make sure my ideas are aligned with everybody else's part and work while working on the features of PayFit, only then I can conclude the final version of PayFit’s features for the other members to continue the project with prototype.|![photo](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFapJ0gZv77IA/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZxSo4stIAAo-/0/1770912975857?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=TjlTt0XIj4DuBCjPqQFNWJZhQDcUBGWFIkLuxiQcIEs) ![photo2](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQEKXwYuL-vExg/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZxSo4s0K8Ak-/0/1770912975861?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=WnSSJIUUOZnZvWZwQ_FOeuUqmVzaNj3nmNWveSZbbcU) ![photo3](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQFVdvRh3GVvqg/feedshare-shrink_800/B56ZxSo4c0KcAk-/0/1770912974873?e=1772668800&v=beta&t=4F3EvDslu2RHMkQ86wqs9z-CFfFSdrkB4Zn_mVkJfC0)
