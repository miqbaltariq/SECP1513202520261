|Industry Visit to UTM Digital    |  Walking out of the open day at UTM,I just kept replaying everything in my head.Before that day,ideas like "AI" and "information systems"always felt like abstract chapters in a textbook.But when the speakers from Canon started sharing real-life stories,especially about the AI tool that monitors patients while protecting their privacy,something just clicked.It was not theory anymore,it was real!What really stuck with me,and what felt most eye-opening,was how they kept talking about"process-centric thinking."The digital facilities presentation explained it perfectly.They pointed out that no matter how advanced a technology is,it still falls short if it is not built into how people actually work day to day. I realized that success is determined by the process a tool supports, not the tool itself,just as a digital twin is useless without real-time data flow.This shifted my perspective,and now I see my degree differently.It is about designing systems that work with people.To put it frankly,I was astounded by how broad technology's impact is,from healthcare to live sports.If I could add one improvement to the day,it would be to hear about messy parts,those real-world "This didn't work and here's why" stories.For example,when outdated data leads to poor decisions,hearing those would definitely make "process-centric thinking" feel even more relatable and deepen our understanding too.By the time I left,everything felt clearer.This was not just a visit,it transformed technology from a collection of available tools into a way of solving real-world human problems,by first understanding processes,people and perspectives involved.True innovation,I now realize,begins with the workflow,not the software.|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bFIVbgYPNPTbdoVyjteMnKj8Ujo4IAG6/view?usp=drivesdk        |
|PC Assemble (Lab Activity)   |To be honest, I don't think I will ever forget that the first time I held a CPU in my palm. It was a little piece of silicon so delicate that I would almost be afraid to breathe on it wrong, and yet it was the brain of a computer. It was wild, right? That feeling of something being incredibly powerful and totally fragile all at once.The PC assembly session was like a lightbulb moment for me.It took everything from the textbooks and made it real,something that I could touch.I still remember clearly the soft click sound the RAM made when it slotted perfectly into place.Then,after what felt like hours of checking every single connection,it turned out to be just a loose power cable.When that monitor finally lit up,our whole team just let out a huge cheer.We could not help it!The thing that frustrated me the most at the beginning was those tangled wires behind the motherboard,which ended up teaching me the biggest lesson.Good design is not just about performance,but also about creating something sustainable and maintainable.If I had one suggestion for next time?I would suggest making the troubleshooting part into a kind of detective game.This is because figuring out that loose cable was honestly when I truly learned to think like an engineer.This experience changed me from someone who just uses technology to someone who gets a peek behind the curtain.I will always understand and respect the craftsmanship behind every working machine.|            |
|Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom    | That online global classroom session completely changed how I see the technology I'm learning to build. It was like realizing these powerful tools we're creating have a conscience, or at least they should. When the speaker shared how Amazon's recruiting AI had actually learned to discriminate against women, it hit me that our algorithms aren't just lines of code, they're mirrors reflecting our own biases back at us. What really stuck with me was seeing how trust in AI breaks down in so many ways, from not being able to explain why it makes certain decisions, to not knowing who's responsible when it fails, and even how it can be weaponized through deepfakes and misinformation. But what gave me hope was learning about the framework for responsible AI that balances innovation with very human concerns like environmental impact, fairness, and keeping humans in the loop. If I could add one thing, I'd love to wrestle with some real ethical dilemmas in small groups during future sessions. This talk fundamentally shifted my perspective, I now understand that building smart systems isn't enough; we need to build wise ones that understand their impact on real people, because the most advanced AI in the world means nothing if it doesn't make life better for the humans it's meant to serve.                              | |
|Industry Talk by PPG    | This talk with PPG did something simple yet profound,it made me see the lines of code I write not as abstract commands, but as the digital glue that holds a global company together. I remember the speaker explaining how a system they built helps teams on different continents feel like they're in the same room, and how their work directly supports PPG's goal to protect our environment and world's best-known products. That connection between my keyboard and a tangible, positive impact is what truly inspired me. For the next session, I'd love to hear not just what they built, but the story of a project that almost failed and how the team pulled through; that human struggle is where the real learning happens. Now, as I open my laptop for my own projects, I'm not just completing an assignment; I'm practicing for a future where I can build technology that serves a purpose and connects people.  |  https://sg.docworkspace.com/d/sIGKv_8nNAfPzpskG?sa=601.1123                         |
