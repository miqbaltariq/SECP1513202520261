|Industry Visit to UTM Digital    |  I just kept replaying back everything in my head after I walked out of the UTM Open Day.Before this,ideas like "AI" and "Technology Power" always felt like abstract concepts that hard to be visualized or seen.However,Mr SK Leong made them visible when he shared real stories,especially about AI monitoring with privacy.It was real and not theory anymore!The part really impressed me was the digital facilities presentation on "process-centric thinking."Dr Ts.Ahmad Sha'rainan Md Shaarani explained if an advanced a technology is not built into daily work,it will fall short.I realized that in order to make a success,the process a tool supports is important, not only just the tool itself,just as without real-time data flow,a digital twin means nothing.To put it frankly,I was amazed by how broad technology's impact is,from healthcare to live sports.To improve that day program,I would suggest hearing about messy parts,those real-world cases scenarios where fail unexpectedly and what are the lessons behind them.For example,the time when outdated data leads to bad decisions.Through hearing those,it would definitely make "process-centric thinking" feel even more relatable and deepen our understanding.By the end,everything felt clearer.The value of this programme was not just a visit,it inspired me on how technology can be utilized to curb real-world human problems,but we need to understand processes,people and perspectives involved before this.I now realize that true innovation is all about the workflow,not just the software.|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bFIVbgYPNPTbdoVyjteMnKj8Ujo4IAG6/view?usp=drivesdk        |
|PC Assemble (Lab Activity)   |For me, I will not forget the first time I held a CPU,just to be honest. CPU was so powerful as a brain of computer. I was afraid to break it down until I keep shivering my hand slightly. The PC assembly session was really an AHA moment for me.Everything from the textbooks were extracted and become real,something that I could even touch.The soft click sound the RAM made when it slotted perfectly into place is really unforgetable.After my teammates and I spending long time of checking every component connection, we successfully placed all the components, but we didn't know if it worked or not.When that monitor finally lit up,our whole team just let out a huge cheer.We could not hold it!The most frustrating thing at the beginning was those tangled wires,which ended up teaching me the biggest lesson.Even though performance is significant for a good,but also it is related to create something sustainable and maintainable.If I need to give suggestion for improvement next time, I would suggest making the troubleshooting part into a kind of detective game.This is because figuring out the problem existed about the cable connections was honestly the moment I truly learned to think like an engineer.This experience changed me from someone who just uses technology to someone who always want to see the inner workings behind a magical machine or component.I will always stay curious about the principles or theory behind every working machine.|            |
|Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom    | That online global classroom session really shook up how I see tech.I used to think the goal was just to build something cool that works,but now I realize the powerful tools we are creating should have a conscience,a sense of right and wrong.Hearing the presentation from Dr. Claude Fachkha about how Amazon's recruiting AI learned to discriminate against women,it hit me that our algorithms are not just code,but that they pick up our own biases and worsen them.What made an impression on me was how fragile trust in AI really is.When it makes a decision,can it explain why?If it fails,who needs to be responsible?It can even become a weapon through deepfakes and misinformation.However,it was not all doom and gloom.From the explanation of Dr.Lanie B.Laureano,learning about frameworks for responsible AI that balance innovation with human concerns like environmental impact,fairness,and human oversight gave me hope.If I could add one thing to future talks,I would love to break into smaller groups and wrestle with some real ethical case studies like "What would you do if..."scenarios.I think debating with classmates can allow us to express our opinions and make ideas feel more personal.This talk taught me that building smart systems is not the end goal anymore.We need to build wise ones because what is the point of the world's most advanced AI if it does not make life better for people it's meant to serve.                              | |
|Industry Talk by PPG    | The talk really helped me connect the dots.It broke working with data down into clear lane which are Master Data,ERP Analytics,Data Lake Analytics and MLOps.This showed me that I could focus on organizing data,pulling insights from ERP systems,building analytics platforms,or even automating machine learning workflows.As a result,I was exposed to how many different career pathways I could take.Moreover,I always think that SQL or Python are separate topics.But,seeing them alongside Azure Data Factory,star schema design,and DevOps practices made me clear how everything fits together in a real job.It gave me clarity on what to learn beyond coursework.In addition,from "SAP CoE Operations Streams"breakdown,I learned that MM,SD,FI/CO are not just acronyms,they are the backbones of a global company.Seeing how processes like "Order to Cash"flow through the company caused enterprise software feel tangible.If there is another session,to help us to see how we could fit in,it would be great to hear someone early in their career at PPG.Just a short chat about their onboarding experience,what kind of projects they worked on in the first few months,and how they were supported throughout their journey.Seeing the diversity in PPG's team and their clear values stayed with me. This made me understand that the kind of workplace I want is not just the job title,but the culture,the people and the purpose.|  https://sg.docworkspace.com/d/sIGKv_8nNAfPzpskG?sa=601.1123                         |
|ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 Opening Ceremony| The biggest thing I got from the summit was seeing quantum technology from two completely different angles.One talk,by Prof.Dr.Masahiro Kitagawa was all about the science,it was amzing to hear how quantum principles are applied into technology like super-secure communication.From the other side,the perspective shared by Mr.Ling Keok Tong was a real eye-opener.He talked about things that I never really considered,like how countries need to build up not just scientists,but entire systems of education,policy and infrastructure to bring quantum to fruition.Do not get me wrong,the talks were fantastic.Nevertheless,as a student,I think we would be more engaged and get even more out of it if we could have some beginner-friendly workshops like Qiskit.Other than that,I also recommend using simulation tools to get our hands dirty,which would help concepts stick more.Meanwhile,a small-group chat with the speakers would also allow us to get direct advice from them.The most personal takeaway was how it messed with my idea of what a "computing problem"even is.Quantum computing,with its concepts of superposition and entanglement,has made me really curious about hybrid systems.I wonder how the near-term quantum processors(NISQ) we have now can match with classical systems to solve tough problems in new ways.This experience motivated me to build quantum literacy now,so I can contribute to ASEAN's quantum future going forward.                          |                               |
|Industry Talk by Serunai Commerce    | This talk given by Ts.Hj.Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Muttalib helped me realize that coding is just the foundation,not the whole building.It was a wake-up call to know that what exactly matters in the industry is how you structure,plan and collaborate,not just how you write loops or functions.Coding is only 40% of the job,the other 60% is system design and project management.The main key lesson is SDLC is basically a roadmap for keeping projects from falling apart.Following phases planning,analysis,design,implementation and maintenance prevent chaotic development.Additionally,when it comes to project management,learning about methodologies like Waterfall and Agile,it made me know that picking the right tool for job is significant.Use Waterfall when there are clear milestones,but use Agile when we need to adapt along the way.Moreover,Agentic Coding got me thinking AI is not here to replace us,but to help us on designing,imagining and problem-solving at a higher level.For further improvements,I suggest adding a real project walkthrough to show how SDLC works in practice.Besides,if possible,providing practical templates like sprint planning for students to use would also be a good way to increase engagement.After this talk, I will combine Waterfall for overall planning with Agile for weekly development to deliver the best quality in my upcoming projects. Besides, I will embrace agentic coding to build a more complex portfolio project that cannot be done on my own. Furthermore, I will treat my assignment like a mini-project, sketch a blueprint, break it into steps, test as I go, and reflect when done.Lastly,I will seek for more team-based projects to improve my collaboration and communication skills.By the time I graduate,I want to be someone who can walk into a real project and make contribution as a thoughtful designer,a planner and an effective teammate.|                             |
