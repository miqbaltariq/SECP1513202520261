|Industry Visit to UTM Digital    |  Walking out of the open day at UTM,I just kept replaying everything in my head.Before that day,ideas like "AI" and always felt like textbook chapters.But when Mr SK Leong shared real stories,especially about AI monitoring with privacy,something just clicked.It was not theory anymore,it was real!What really stuck with me was the digital facilities presentation on "process-centric thinking."Dr Ts.Ahmad Sha'rainan Md Shaarani explained that no matter how advanced a technology is,it still falls short if it is not built into daily work. I realized that success is depends on the process a tool supports, not the tool itself,just as a digital twin is useless without real-time data flow.To put it frankly,I was astounded by how broad technology's impact is,from healthcare to live sports.To improve the day,I would suggest hearing about messy parts,those real-world "This didn't work and here's why" stories.For example,when outdated data leads to poor decisions,hearing those would definitely make "process-centric thinking" feel even more relatable and deepen our understanding too.By the end,everything felt clearer.This was not just a visit,it transformed technology from tools into a way of solving real-world human problems,by first understanding processes,people and perspectives involved.True innovation,I now realize,begins with the workflow,not the software.|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bFIVbgYPNPTbdoVyjteMnKj8Ujo4IAG6/view?usp=drivesdk        |
|PC Assemble (Lab Activity)   |To be honest, I will never forget that the first time I held a CPU. It was a little piece of silicon so delicate that I was afraid to breathe on it wrong, yet it was the brain of a computer. That wild feeling of something being incredibly powerful and totally fragile all at once.The PC assembly session was like a lightbulb moment.It took everything from the textbooks and made it real,something that I could touch.I still remember clearly the soft click sound the RAM made when it slotted perfectly into place.After what felt like hours of checking every connection,it turned out to be just a loose power cable.When that monitor finally lit up,our whole team just let out a huge cheer.We could not help it!The thing that frustrated me the most at the beginning was those tangled wires,which ended up teaching me the biggest lesson.Good design is not just about performance,but also about creating something sustainable and maintainable.If I had one suggestion for next time?I would suggest making the troubleshooting part into a kind of detective game.This is because figuring out that loose cable was honestly when I truly learned to think like an engineer.This experience changed me from someone who just uses technology to someone who gets a peek behind the curtain.I will always understand and respect the craftsmanship behind every working machine.|            |
|Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom    | That online global classroom session really shook up how I see tech.I used to think the goal was just to build something cool that works,but now I realize the powerful tools we are creating should have a conscience,a sense of right and wrong.Hearing the presentation from Dr. Claude Fachkha about how Amazon's recruiting AI learned to discriminate against women,it hit me that our algorithms are not just code,but that they pick up our own biases and worsen them.What made an impression on me was how fragile trust in AI really is.When it makes a decision,can it explain why?If it fails,who needs to be responsible?It can even become a weapon through deepfakes and misinformation.However,it was not all doom and gloom.From the explanation of Dr.Lanie B.Laureano,learning about frameworks for responsible AI that balance innovation with human concerns like environmental impact,fairness,and human oversight gave me hope.If I could add one thing to future talks,I would love to break into smaller groups and wrestle with some real ethical case studies like "What would you do if..."scenarios.I think debating with classmates can allow us to express our opinions and make ideas feel more personal.This talk taught me that building smart systems is not the end goal anymore.We need to build wise ones because what is the point of the world's most advanced AI if it does not make life better for people it's meant to serve.                              | |
|Industry Talk by PPG    | The talk really helped me connect the dots.It broke working with data down into clear lane which are Master Data,ERP Analytics,Data Lake Analytics and MLOps.This showed me that I could focus on organizing data,pulling insights from ERP systems,building analytics platforms,or even automating machine learning workflows.As a result,I was exposed to how many different career pathways I could take.Moreover,I always think that SQL or Python are separate topics.But,seeing them alongside Azure Data Factory,star schema design,and DevOps practices made me clear how everything fits together in a real job.It gave me clarity on what to learn beyond coursework.In addition,from "SAP CoE Operations Streams"breakdown,I learned that MM,SD,FI/CO are not just acronyms,they are the backbones of a global company.Seeing how processes like "Order to Cash"flow through the company caused enterprise software feel tangible.If there is another session,to help us to see how we could fit in,it would be great to hear someone early in their career at PPG.Just a short chat about their onboarding experience,what kind of projects they worked on in the first few months,and how they were supported throughout their journey.Seeing the diversity in PPG's team and their clear values stayed with me. This made me understand that the kind of workplace I want is not just the job title,but the culture,the people and the purpose.|  https://sg.docworkspace.com/d/sIGKv_8nNAfPzpskG?sa=601.1123                         |
