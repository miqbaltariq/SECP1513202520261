|Industry Visit to UTM Digital    |  Walking out of the open day at UTM,I just kept replaying everything in my head.Before that day,ideas like "AI" and "information systems"always felt like abstract chapters in a textbook.But when the speakers from Canon started sharing real-life stories,especially about the AI tool that monitors patients while protecting their privacy,something just clicked.It was not theory anymore,it was real!

What really stuck with me and most eye-opening was how they kept talking about"process-centric thinking."The digital facilities presentation explained it perfectly.They had pointed out that no matter how advanced a tech is,it still falls short if it is not built into how people actually work day to day. I realized that success is determined by the process a tool supports, not the tool itself,just as a digital twin is useless without real-time data flow.This shifted my perspective and now I see my degree differently.It is designing systems that interact with people.

To be honest,I was astounded by how broad technology's impact is,from healthcare to live sports.If I could add one improvement to the day,it would be to hear about messy failure parts too.You know,those real-world "This didn't work and here's why" stories.For example,when outdated data leads to poor decisions.Hearing those would definitely make "process-centric thinking" feel even more relatable and enrich our knowledge too.

By the time I left,it all felt clearer.This was not just a visit,it transformed technology from a collection of available tools into a way of solving real-world human problems,by first understanding processes,people and perspectives involved.True innovation,I now realize,begins with the workflow instead of software.     |https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bFIVbgYPNPTbdoVyjteMnKj8Ujo4IAG6/view?usp=drivesdk        |
|PC Assemble (Lab Activity)   |I'll never forget the moment I held a CPU in my palm for the first time. This tiny, delicate piece of silicon that powers entire computers felt both incredibly powerful and surprisingly fragile. The PC assembly session turned all the abstract concepts from our textbooks into something real under my fingertips. I still remember the quiet "click" when the RAM slotted perfectly into place, and the collective cheer our team let out when the screen finally lit up after what felt like forever troubleshooting a loose power cable. Those tangled wires that frustrated me at first actually taught me the most valuable lesson, that good design isn't just about performance, but about creating something sustainable and maintainable. If I could add one thing to future sessions, it would be turning troubleshooting into a mystery game where we diagnose intentional "faults", because that's when we truly learned to think like engineers. This experience changed me from someone who just uses technology to someone who understands and respects the craftsmanship behind every working machine.            |            |
|Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom    | That online global classroom session completely changed how I see the technology I'm learning to build. It was like realizing these powerful tools we're creating have a conscience, or at least they should. When the speaker shared how Amazon's recruiting AI had actually learned to discriminate against women, it hit me that our algorithms aren't just lines of code, they're mirrors reflecting our own biases back at us. What really stuck with me was seeing how trust in AI breaks down in so many ways, from not being able to explain why it makes certain decisions, to not knowing who's responsible when it fails, and even how it can be weaponized through deepfakes and misinformation. But what gave me hope was learning about the framework for responsible AI that balances innovation with very human concerns like environmental impact, fairness, and keeping humans in the loop. If I could add one thing, I'd love to wrestle with some real ethical dilemmas in small groups during future sessions. This talk fundamentally shifted my perspective, I now understand that building smart systems isn't enough; we need to build wise ones that understand their impact on real people, because the most advanced AI in the world means nothing if it doesn't make life better for the humans it's meant to serve.                              | |
|Industry Talk by PPG    | This talk with PPG did something simple yet profound,it made me see the lines of code I write not as abstract commands, but as the digital glue that holds a global company together. I remember the speaker explaining how a system they built helps teams on different continents feel like they're in the same room, and how their work directly supports PPG's goal to protect our environment and world's best-known products. That connection between my keyboard and a tangible, positive impact is what truly inspired me. For the next session, I'd love to hear not just what they built, but the story of a project that almost failed and how the team pulled through; that human struggle is where the real learning happens. Now, as I open my laptop for my own projects, I'm not just completing an assignment; I'm practicing for a future where I can build technology that serves a purpose and connects people.  |  https://sg.docworkspace.com/d/sIGKv_8nNAfPzpskG?sa=601.1123                         |
