|1|Industry Visit to UTM Digital    |  I just kept replaying back everything in my head after I walked out of the UTM Open Day.Before this,ideas like "AI" and "Technology Power" always felt like abstract concepts that hard to be visualized or seen.However,Mr SK Leong made them visible when he shared real stories,especially about AI monitoring with privacy.It was real and not theory anymore!The part really impressed me was the digital facilities presentation on "process-centric thinking."Dr Ts.Ahmad Sha'rainan Md Shaarani explained if an advanced a technology is not built into daily work,it will fall short.I realized that in order to make a success,the process a tool supports is important, not only just the tool itself,just as without real-time data flow,a digital twin means nothing.To put it frankly,I was amazed by how broad technology's impact is,from healthcare to live sports.<br><br>To improve that day program,I would suggest hearing about messy parts,those real-world cases scenarios where fail unexpectedly and what are the lessons behind them.For example,the time when outdated data leads to bad decisions.Through hearing those,it would definitely make "process-centric thinking" feel even more relatable and deepen our understanding.<br><br>By the end,everything felt clearer.The value of this programme was not just a visit,it inspired me on how technology can be utilized to curb real-world human problems,but we need to understand processes,people and perspectives involved before this.I now realize that true innovation is all about the workflow,not just the software.|     [drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bFIVbgYPNPTbdoVyjteMnKj8Ujo4IAG6/view?usp=drivesdk)|
|2|PC Assemble (Lab Activity)   |For me, I will not forget the first time I held a CPU,just to be honest. CPU was so powerful as a brain of computer. I was afraid to break it down until I keep shivering my hand slightly. The PC assembly session was really an AHA moment for me.Everything from the textbooks were extracted and become real,something that I could even touch.The soft click sound the RAM made when it slotted perfectly into place is really unforgetable.After my teammates and I spending long time of checking every component connection, we successfully placed all the components, but we didn't know if it worked or not.When that monitor finally lit up,our whole team just let out a huge cheer.We could not hold it!The most frustrating thing at the beginning was those tangled wires,which ended up teaching me the biggest lesson.Even though performance is significant for a good,but also it is related to create something sustainable and maintainable.<br><br>If I need to give suggestion for improvement next time, I would suggest making the troubleshooting part into a kind of detective game.This is because figuring out the problem existed about the cable connections was honestly the moment I truly learned to think like an engineer.<br><br>This experience changed me from someone who just uses technology to someone who always want to see the inner workings behind a magical machine or component.I will always stay curious about the principles or theory behind every working machine.|     |
|3|Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom    | My view on technology was really shaken up by this online global classroom session. I used to think the goal was just to build something cool that works,but now I realize the more important part is powerful tools we are creating should have a conscience, as well as sense of right and wrong.Hearing the excellent presentation from Dr. Claude Fachkha about how Amazon's recruiting AI learned to discriminate against women,it made me realized that our algorithms are not just codes,but maybe they will pick up our own biases and worsen them.What made an impression on me was how fragile trust in AI really is.When it makes a decision,can it explain why?If it fails,who needs to be responsible?It can even become a weapon when it comes to deepfakes and misinformation.However,it was not hopeless at all.From the explanation of Dr.Lanie B.Laureano,innovation and human concerns like enviuronmental impacts,fairness and human oversight can be balanced and both be taken care if every person learns about responsible use of AI frameworks.<br><br>If I could add one thing to future talks,I would suggest to all the participants break into smaller groups ,discuss and express opinions on some real ethical case studies like "What would you do if..."scenarios.I think discussing and debating with classmates can allow us to express our opinions and different points of view can be shared.<br><br>This talk taught me that building smart systems is not enough anymore,however,we need to build wise systems because the most advanced AI is useless if it does not improve life of people it's meant to serve. | |
|4|Industry Talk by PPG    | The talk really gave me all the answers I wanted on many questions that I had thought before.First and foremost,PPG data and analytics strategy was well-organized.It breaks down the technical ecosystem into four different pillars,including Master Data,ERP Analytics,Data Lake Analytics and MLOps.Each of them have different functions,such as master Data management serves as foundational layer to focus on support of operations,whereas MLOps automate and streamline the delivery of Machine Learning models.As a result,I knew that actually there are many different career pathways I could take.Moreover,I always think that SQL or Python are not related topics before this.But,I was amazed that how everything will be combined together in a real job after seeing them alongside Azure Data Factory,star schema design,and DevOps.It gave me clarity on what to learn beyond coursework.In addition,I learned that terms like MM,SD,FI and CO are not just acronyms,but they are the backbones of a global company,from sharing of "SAP CoE Operations Streams" breakdown.company.Other than that,knowing future IT infrastructure trends encourages me to deepen my knowledge in those trends such as IT Infrastructure Evolution,AI-driven IT Operations and Edge Computing.<br><br>If there is another session that can explain more about how we can adapt ourselves in  a new environment when we start to work,it would be great to hear someone early in their career at PPG.It can be just a short chat about their onboarding experience,what kind of projects they worked on in the first few months,and their stories supported by mentors or colleagues throughout their journey.<br><br>The diversity in PPG's team and their clear values such as aligning with sustainable goal development(SDG) stayed with me.This made me understand that the kind of workplace I want is the culture,the people and the purpose,but not just the job title.|   [link](https://sg.docworkspace.com/d/sIGKv_8nNAfPzpskG?sa=601.1123)|
|5|ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 Opening Ceremony|The most important thing that I learned from this summit was learning about quantum technology from two completely different perspectives.One talk presented by Prof.Dr.Masahiro Kitagawa was purely about science,which was amazing to learn about how quantum theory is being harnessed in technology such as ultra-secure communication.On the other hand,a different perspective shared by Mr.Ling Keok Tong was an eye-opening experience.He discussed things that I never thought about,like how countries must develop not just scientists,but an entire framework of learning,infrastructure and so on to develop quantum technology into reality.<br><br>Trust me,both talks were great,however,as a student,what I feel is that we might be more active and learn even more if we were given some introductory workshops such as Qiskit.In this regard,another suggestion that I have is we should try using some interesting kind of simulations in order to "get our hands dirty",and hence this can help retain concepts in our minds.At the same time,another suggestion that I have is that we can have small group discussions with these speakers in order to gain direct advices from them.<br><br>The most personal experience was how it challenged my understanding of what constitutes a "computing problem".The concepts of quantum computing,including those of superposition and entanglement had led me to be fascinated about hybrid models.I would like to know,for instance,how these current trends quantum computing technology like NISQ have might be paired together with classical models in order to tackle tough problems in fantastic ways.This experience led me to develop a sense of learning about quantum literacy in order to develop quantum in ASEAN in the future.|                               |
|6|Industry Talk by Serunai Commerce    | This talk given by Ts.Hj.Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Muttalib opened my eyes to the point that coding is just a foundation, but not the whole structure. It was a wake-up call for me to realize that it is not merely coding,but planning and collaboration also matter in the field. In an IT related job,coding occupies 40%,while the other 60% is system design and project management. The most important key take away is that SDLC is basically a roadmap for avoiding project collapse. By following the stages of planning, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance, it can prevent chaotic development. In addition, by learning project management concepts such as Waterfall and Agile methodologies, it gave me a clear idea that selecting the most appropriate method for achieving our goals is important. In managing a project,I should use Waterfall when there are clear milestones,but use Agile for adapting to changes. In addition, by learning the meaning of Agentic Coding, it gave me a new idea that AI is not meant for replacing us,but for assisting us in designing, imagining, and problem-solving on a higher level. <br><br>For future improvements, I think it would be a great idea if a project walk-through could be incorporated to demonstrate working of SDLC. Other than that, if possible, providing templates such as sprint planning for students to use would also be a great way for increasing students’ engagements.<br><br> After this talk, I will use Waterfall for overall planning,whereas I will use Agile for weekly coding development to produce the best quality of possible project outcomes. In addition, I will apply agentic coding for designing a complex portfolio project that I could not do by myself. In addition, I will apply project thinking mindset for my assignments by creating a blue print for it,breaking it down into steps, testing it, and do reflections upon completion. Lastly, I will look for more project engagements to enhance my collaboration and communication skills. By the time I graduated, I hope that I could walk into a real project setting and contribute to it by being a thoughtful designer, planner and a good collaborator.|                             |
|7|Industry Visit to Etiqa Insurance|This visit to Etiqa proved to be very insightful in terms of the practical applications of data engineering in the insurance industry. I gained knowledge about how databases function as assets that need proper security measures and how even simple conversations could lead to the creation of useful personal data.The impressive applications of AI in validating images for insurance claims, and how this actively helps customers affected by disasters to autoclaim their policy using database technology,making me realizing the purpose of learning hard is to help more people using knowledge gained.<br><br>For a better engagement with the students, I think it would be helpful if the presentation included interactive components. A data analysis exercise or a quiz game with regards to the topic discussed would greatly improve the presentation.<br><br>This experience has opened my eyes to the possibilities that data engineering could offer. Witnessing how Etiqa utilizes technology not for business gains alone but for the greater good, proactively trying to help those in need, was inspiring for me. Through joining this industrial visit to Etiqa,it also made me realize that behind each data point,there are people with different needs. For examples,with RM100 in hand,some of the people will choose to use bus to go back from Johor to Kedah,but there are someone also will choose to use train ETS instead.So,database is important to help us analyze and decides which is the best way.I now view my field not just as a technical subject but as a way to make a positive impact in society, thanks to this eye-opening experience.                               |                             |
