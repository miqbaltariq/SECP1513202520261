|Industry Visit to UTM Digital    |  Walking out of the UTM Digital open day, my head was buzzing with new ideas. Before this, concepts like 'AI' and 'information systems' felt like abstract chapters in a textbook. But hearing the Canon speakers share real stories, like the AI radar that monitors patients without invading their privacy, everything clicked into place.The biggest lightbulb moment for me was understanding that it's not just about the tech, but the "process-centric thinking" behind it. I realized that the success of any tech tool depends on the process it supports, not just the tool itself. This completely shifted my perspective on what my course is really about.I was genuinely amazed by how broad technology's impact is, from saving lives to broadcasting the World Cup. It made me excited to be studying in this field. If I could suggest one thing, I believe hearing about real-world failure cases and their solutions would make the concept of "process-centric thinking" even more memorable.This visit didn't just teach me, it showed me why what I'm learning matters. It transformed technology from a set of tools into a way of solving real human problems.     |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|PC Assemble (Lab Activity)   |I'll never forget the moment I held a CPU in my palm for the first time. This tiny, delicate piece of silicon that powers entire computers felt both incredibly powerful and surprisingly fragile. The PC assembly session turned all the abstract concepts from our textbooks into something real under my fingertips. I still remember the quiet "click" when the RAM slotted perfectly into place, and the collective cheer our team let out when the screen finally lit up after what felt like forever troubleshooting a loose power cable. Those tangled wires that frustrated me at first actually taught me the most valuable lesson, that good design isn't just about performance, but about creating something sustainable and maintainable. If I could add one thing to future sessions, it would be turning troubleshooting into a mystery game where we diagnose intentional "faults", because that's when we truly learned to think like engineers. This experience changed me from someone who just uses technology to someone who understands and respects the craftsmanship behind every working machine.            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
