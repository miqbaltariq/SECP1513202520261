|Industry Visit to UTM Digital    |  Walking out of the UTM Digital open day, my head was buzzing with new ideas. Before this, concepts like 'AI' and 'information systems' felt like abstract chapters in a textbook. But hearing the Canon speakers share real stories, like the AI radar that monitors patients without invading their privacy, everything clicked into place.The biggest lightbulb moment for me was understanding that it's not just about the tech, but the "process-centric thinking" behind it. I realized that the success of any tech tool depends on the process it supports, not just the tool itself. This completely shifted my perspective on what my course is really about.I was genuinely amazed by how broad technology's impact is, from saving lives to broadcasting the World Cup. It made me excited to be studying in this field. If I could suggest one thing, I believe hearing about real-world failure cases and their solutions would make the concept of "process-centric thinking" even more memorable.This visit didn't just teach me, it showed me why what I'm learning matters. It transformed technology from a set of tools into a way of solving real human problems.     |https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bFIVbgYPNPTbdoVyjteMnKj8Ujo4IAG6/view?usp=drivesdk        |
|PC Assemble (Lab Activity)   |I'll never forget the moment I held a CPU in my palm for the first time. This tiny, delicate piece of silicon that powers entire computers felt both incredibly powerful and surprisingly fragile. The PC assembly session turned all the abstract concepts from our textbooks into something real under my fingertips. I still remember the quiet "click" when the RAM slotted perfectly into place, and the collective cheer our team let out when the screen finally lit up after what felt like forever troubleshooting a loose power cable. Those tangled wires that frustrated me at first actually taught me the most valuable lesson, that good design isn't just about performance, but about creating something sustainable and maintainable. If I could add one thing to future sessions, it would be turning troubleshooting into a mystery game where we diagnose intentional "faults", because that's when we truly learned to think like engineers. This experience changed me from someone who just uses technology to someone who understands and respects the craftsmanship behind every working machine.            |            |
|Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom    | That online global classroom session completely changed how I see the technology I'm learning to build. It was like realizing these powerful tools we're creating have a conscience, or at least they should. When the speaker shared how Amazon's recruiting AI had actually learned to discriminate against women, it hit me that our algorithms aren't just lines of code, they're mirrors reflecting our own biases back at us. What really stuck with me was seeing how trust in AI breaks down in so many ways, from not being able to explain why it makes certain decisions, to not knowing who's responsible when it fails, and even how it can be weaponized through deepfakes and misinformation. But what gave me hope was learning about the framework for responsible AI that balances innovation with very human concerns like environmental impact, fairness, and keeping humans in the loop. If I could add one thing, I'd love to wrestle with some real ethical dilemmas in small groups during future sessions. This talk fundamentally shifted my perspective, I now understand that building smart systems isn't enough; we need to build wise ones that understand their impact on real people, because the most advanced AI in the world means nothing if it doesn't make life better for the humans it's meant to serve.                              | |
|Industry Talk by PPG    | This talk with PPG did something simple yet profound,it made me see the lines of code I write not as abstract commands, but as the digital glue that holds a global company together. I remember the speaker explaining how a system they built helps teams on different continents feel like they're in the same room, and how their work directly supports PPG's goal to protect our environment and world's best-known products. That connection between my keyboard and a tangible, positive impact is what truly inspired me. For the next session, I'd love to hear not just what they built, but the story of a project that almost failed and how the team pulled through; that human struggle is where the real learning happens. Now, as I open my laptop for my own projects, I'm not just completing an assignment; I'm practicing for a future where I can build technology that serves a purpose and connects people.  |  https://sg.docworkspace.com/d/sIGKv_8nNAfPzpskG?sa=601.1123                         |
