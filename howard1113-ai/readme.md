| 5 | Industry Talk 2: Project Management & System Development | This talk helped me understand the real differences between Waterfall and Agile in software development using simple, relatable examples. The speaker explained how Waterfall is a linear approach suitable for fixed requirements, while Agile allows flexibility, quick changes, and continuous feedback. I learned how real software projects involve many roles—developers, designers, testers, deployment engineers—and teamwork is essential because no one can build a full system alone. The cooking analogies made the concepts easier to understand: Waterfall follows strict steps like cooking nasi lemak with a fixed recipe, while Agile adapts quickly like turning white rice into fried rice based on new requirements. Overall, the session improved my understanding of project management methodologies and how they are applied in real software teams, especially in modern companies that prefer Agile for flexibility and faster development. | ![Industry Talk 2](https://github.com/miqbaltariq/SECP1513202520261/blob/main/howard1113-ai/Industry%20Talk%202.jpeg) |
