| 1 | Open Day UTMDigital 2025 | Today, I had the chance to visit the UTMDigital Open Day 2025, and it was a really meaningful experience as this is my first industrial visit ever. I got to explore different digital showcases, learn about new technologies, and understand how technologies are moving towards digital transformations. <br> The sessions and exhibitions gave me a clearer picture of how technology supports real operations, and it definitely motivated me to keep learning in my field. A simple event, but it left a strong impact on my journey as a tech student.  | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8750e73b-df37-4b31-96e0-1b2eb9fc0e47" width="975"> <br> <br> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e04d96b-0b00-4ee1-89c9-50048a722490" width="975"> |
| 2 | ONLINE Global Classroom | The ONLINE Global Classroom is organised by the faculty together with international partners like the University of Dubai and Davao Oriental State University. The session focused on "Building Trust in Intelligent Systems" and gave me valuable insights into AI, cybersecurity, digital trust, and ethics. <br> It was such a meaningful experience to hear perspectives from global speakers and understand how trust and responsibility play a huge role in intelligent systems.  | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/203e3f3d-fc67-44ed-b58f-add324b5601d" width="975">|
| 3 | PPG Industry Talk | I attended the PPG Industry Talk organised under SECP1513, and it turned out to be a very thoughtful session. Hearing directly from PPG Industries helped me understand the skills and values that companies look for in students, especially those preparing for future industrial training. <br> The speaker also shared real experiences from the IT field, which gave me clearer expectations about the industry and made me feel more confident about my study pathway.  | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44df8354-5ada-483a-817d-0d2863f9edcc" width="975"> <br> <br> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abf8e03b-a638-4b18-a789-f1d36e9521d2" width="975"> |
| 4 | ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 | I had the opportunity to attend the ASEAN Quantum Summit held at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, and it was a truly eye-opening experience. The event brought together experts and representatives from different countries to share insights on the future of quantum technology in our region. <br> Although the topics were advanced, the session inspired me to keep learning and to appreciate how fast technology is evolving globally. It was a meaningful exposure and definitely one of the most impactful events I have attended as a tech student.   | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dee9733b-2d96-4fda-a84d-014f6cad2a33" width="975"> <br> <br> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37eb12d2-4057-4b0f-9080-b8de9300d177" width="975">|

| 7 | PC Maintenance Session | The PC Maintenance hands-on is where we learned how to safely disassemble and assemble the internal components of a computer with the help of the lab assistants. We have to identify parts like the motherboard, RAM, and CPU, and explore how everything connects inside the system. <br> It was a simple but very revealing practical session, especially for someone in tech. Handling the hardware directly helped me understand the foundation of how computers worked beyond what we see in diagrams.   | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62c26b8b-c471-4744-82c4-49f21b7e13ed" width="975"> <br> <br> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2fc0807-8c95-4963-8f75-df711a983fa9" width="975"> |
| 8 | Design Thinking Project | I recently completed the Design Thinking Project with my teammates, and it was such a meaningful learning experience. Through all the phases, we learned how to understand real user needs and turn problems into practical solutions. <br> This project helped me think more creatively, collaborate better, and approach problems from a ser perspective. It was a simple project, but it taught me a lot about how important critical thinking and teamwork are when developing ideas.    | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b728d979-d3c9-4e58-8746-f5083ff13656" width="975"> <br> <br> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36ed0f5e-4e19-4e32-8d70-97c22f0b337d" width="975"> |
