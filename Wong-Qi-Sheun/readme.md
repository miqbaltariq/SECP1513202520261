|1               |Video: Industry visit 1 at UTM digital  | 28-Oct-2025 |Walking through the exhibits, I wasn't just looking at gear; I was seeing the bridge between my classes and the real world. A few highlights that really stuck with me: Canon & D-Ron Malaysia: Their setups were more than just cool gadgets, they showed me what digital transformation actually looks like in practice. The Operational Side: Seeing how these companies function day-to-day made the industry feel less like a concept and more like a career I can actually see myself in.                              |

There’s a huge difference between seeing a diagram of a motherboard and actually feeling the "click" when you seat a stick of RAM. Identifying exactly where the memory sits and seeing how compact modern storage has become compared to what I imagined. Seeing the wired connections up close was a reality check, it’s not just about plugging things in, it’s about understanding the flow of power and data across the board.                              |
|3               |Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom                               |18-Nov-2025                             |I used to see Blockchain, AI, and Cybersecurity as separate lanes. Now, I see them as a combined foundation. You can't have a truly intelligent system if it isn't secure or transparent. Optimization > Development: It’s not enough to just make an algorithm work anymore. The real challenge is optimizing for Digital Trust. If people don't trust the system, the most innovative code in the world is useless. The Balancing Act: The quote about balancing innovation with ethics really hit home. It made me realize that as a future developer, I’m not just a coder, but I’m a gatekeeper for privacy and security.                              |
|4               |Industry Talk: PPG                               |20-Nov-2025                             |While hearing about SAP S/4HANA and the work at the Malaysia Technology Center (MYTC) was technically cool, the real "lightbulb moment" for me was their take on what makes a graduate hireable. It was actually a relief to hear that a 4.0 GPA isn't the only thing that matters. PPG really emphasized being a well-rounded person. They value people who get involved in clubs and competitions. It turns out those "soft skills" I’m building outside of lectures are just as critical as the code I’m writing. It shifted my mindset from "I need to ace this exam" to "I need to be a functional human who can collaborate and lead. "                              |
|5               |ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025                               |11-Dec-2025                             |It’s not just about "faster" computers; it’s about how this tech could completely flip the script on security and logistics. Sitting in a room with world-class experts really brought me back to why I chose to study tech. It’s that feeling of "endless possibilities" that makes the late-night coding sessions worth it. The world is moving incredibly fast. It’s a little scary, but mostly just massive motivation to keep learning so I don't get left behind.                              |
|6               |Industry Talk: Serunai Commerce                               |18-Dec-2025                             |Hearing how giants like Petronas and Intel have ditched rigid planning for adaptability made me realize that being "good at tech" isn't just about following a plan—it's about how fast you can pivot when things change. AI can do the heavy lifting, but it’s useless if I don't understand the underlying architecture and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). I need to be the architect, not just the person hitting "generate." The way he talked about SDLC made it feel less like a boring textbook chapter and more like a survival kit. It's the language of the professional world, and I need to own it if I want to build systems that actually last.                              |
|7               |Industrial Visit 2 at Etiqa Insurance                               |15-Jan-2025                             |I used to think of data engineering as just moving files around. Now, I see it as the "hidden backbone." Without the infrastructure we build, the smartest AI and the best analysts have nothing to work with. The quote, _"Without data, you can’t do anything,"_ really stuck. It’s not just about numbers, it’s about risk, safety, and people’s lives. Seeing how data drives every strategic decision at Etiqa made my major feel so much more consequential. It was eye-opening to see how "cold" tech like automated claims and mobile systems are actually used to make life easier for customers. It reminded me that my end goal isn't just a clean pipeline, it’s a better human experience.                              |
|8               |Design Thinking Project                               |29-Jan-2025                             |Technology can be a social enabler for those who are sidelined. In "Empathy," by focusing on the "shy athlete," we saw that people don't participate in sports because of lack of interest, but because of high social barriers to find a partner. "PlayMatch" showed me that a good interface can create a "safe space" for people to make connections, rather than social pressure, and that technology can lay the groundwork for a "real-world friendship." I also saw how much "friction" there is in daily life because of fragmented systems. Not just a hassle, booking a court can actually discourage healthy living because of a lack of clear instructions, using phone calls and messages instead. Instant-Sync transparency can turn a "booking maze" into a clear path, empowering people to act with confidence. And, technology can encourage people to behave in a more desirable way. Our "Trust Point System" is not just a penalty, but creates a "reliable ecosystem" in which people respect each other's time, teaching people that technology can instill professional values in a casual community, while keeping the "human touch" friendly and reliable.                              |
