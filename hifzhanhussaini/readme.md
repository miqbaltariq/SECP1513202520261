|Assignment1     |  Industrial visit to UTM digital                             |My  friends  and  I  attended the UTMDigital Open Day, where  we  learned  about  innovative  technologies  being  used  in  industries  to  improve  productivity,  safety, and efficiency.  We  attended  an  excellent  presentation  from  Canon  and SK Leong that  highlighted Canon's new  SmartBoard and its life-saving fall  detection AI for patients in Singapore. The  technology  describes how automating repetitive tasks enables  people to focus on  the  more complex challenges in  life,  improving both productivity and quality of living. Overall, our visit to  UTMDigital  Open  Day  made  us  realize  the  importance  of  being  ethically  responsible  innovators and knowing  that in this rapidly changing digital world,  we  will  need  to  continue  to  adapt  and  embrace  lifelong  learning.                               |[Video](https://youtu.be/PAjjVExgFEk?si=a3Drw5Q34KhUTPh_)                              |
|Assignment2    |PC maintenance                               |My group took part in the PC Maintenance  Hands-On  Practical  that  involved  taking  apart  computers , including opening  up the cases  and  taking  out the fans  of  the  CPUs,. The  experience was invaluable  because  it  exposed  me  to the physical make  up of the computers.It  was  a great team-building  experience,  and I think an extended session would have allowed  for  exploration  of  more advanced troubleshooting techniques.  All  in  all, this  hands-on practical provided  me  with a well-rounded foundation in hardware, and I believe  that the skills  I  developed  will  last a long time.                               |  [photo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sxAF2Jy8MLkwVBPpa2samHdWRAzLoTku?usp=drive_link)                           |
