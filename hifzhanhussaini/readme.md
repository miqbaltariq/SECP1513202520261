|Assignment1     |  Industrial visit to UTM digital                             |My  friends  and  I  attended the UTMDigital Open Day, where  we  learned  about  innovative  technologies  being  used  in  industries  to  improve  productivity,  safety, and efficiency.  We  attended  an  excellent  presentation  from  Canon  and SK Leong that  highlighted Canon's new  SmartBoard and its life-saving fall  detection AI for patients in Singapore. The  technology  describes how automating repetitive tasks enables  people to focus on  the  more complex challenges in  life,  improving both productivity and quality of living. Overall, our visit to  UTMDigital  Open  Day  made  us  realize  the  importance  of  being  ethically  responsible  innovators and knowing  that in this rapidly changing digital world,  we  will  need  to  continue  to  adapt  and  embrace  lifelong  learning.                               |[Video](https://youtu.be/PAjjVExgFEk?si=a3Drw5Q34KhUTPh_)                              |
|Assignment2    |PC maintenance                               |My group took part in the PC Maintenance  Hands-On  Practical  that  involved  taking  apart  computers , including opening  up the cases  and  taking  out the fans  of  the  CPUs. The  experience was invaluable  because  it  exposed  me  to the physical make  up of the computers. It  was  a great team-building  experience,  and I think an extended session would have allowed  for  exploration  of  more advanced troubleshooting techniques.  All  in  all, this  hands-on practical provided  me  with a well-rounded foundation in hardware, and I believe  that the skills  I  developed  will  last a long time.                               |  [Photo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pvfo_5HE9C39Hwz4N8tk9Urgnf2pj9wr?usp=sharing)                           |
|Assignment3    |Industrial talk: Online Global Classroom                               |The talk gave me a much deeper perspective on building trust in intelligent systems through the integration of AI, Cybersecurity, and Blockchain. It was eye-opening to see how these fields must work together within ethical and transparent frameworks to ensure the systems we build are truly responsible. Since AI is now ubiquitous, it is critical to follow strict development guidelines and curb misuse in cyber-related crimes. This experience drove home the point that being a future data engineer isn't just about pure coding, it's about integrating governance and security into every infrastructure we build. While the session was insightful, adding hands-on labs in the future would be a great way to engage more directly with these concepts, reinforcing that responsible innovation is the only way to sustain public trust in technology.                               |[Photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HifEIDCSfv-eSk4Ba_m2T81vlsh2jfZC/view?usp=drive_link)                             |
|Assignment4    |Industrial talk by PPG                               |The presentation illustrated how PPG uses tools like Azure, Databricks, and MLOps—all of which are controlled by an advanced "Plan, Build, Run" framework—to incorporate data-driven decision-making. It was intriguing to observe how they use IT to solve practical issues, such as ship surface protection and supply chain logistics, while pursuing the challenging 2030 Sustainability Goals. The need for students to move from academic theory to managing intricate cloud datasets and navigating Zero-Trust infrastructures was brought home by this experience. The MYTC Internship Program and PPG's emphasis on digital transformation ultimately provided me with a clear path to becoming a technological leader capable of bridging the gap between global business strategy and IT innovation.                               |[Poster](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pjZLFNxN5ubH7X1xt6d9O7lSUtbSHYiv?usp=sharing)                            |
|Assignment5    |Asean Quantum Summit                               |I recently went to an industry presentation by Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd that examined project management positions in the IT industry as part of our Technology Information System curriculum. My perspective on teamwork has changed as a result of the session; I now see how important it is to have a project management mindset when working on academic assignments. The conversation about "Agile" approaches struck a particularly deep chord, emphasising the importance of dynamic approaches in meeting the changing needs of digital product development. The speaker also offered an important caution regarding AI in our research. They underlined that if caution is not exercised, an excessive dependence on AI may result in graduates who lack solid foundational knowledge. bOverall, the speaker's captivating and polished delivery made for a satisfying experience.                                | [Photo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BmvJtTZhP6_i24pamQZwpCpxPyJK_M6S?usp=sharing)                            |
|Assignment6    |Industrial Talk by Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd.                               |I recently had the honour of attending a thought-provoking industry presentation at UTM by Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd that addressed the realities of project management in the IT sector. A key takeaway for me was the importance of the "Agile Mindset" for navigating the ever-changing landscape of digital product development a strategy I now plan to implement in my upcoming group projects. The speaker also made a crucial point about upholding "AI Integrity" and avoiding the pitfalls of using tools to circumvent learning, which serves as a powerful reminder to put establishing a strong knowledge base first. Overall, the speaker was very engaging and professional in simplifying difficult ideas, and I hope UTM hosts more events like this to keep us motivated and prepared for the industry.                              | [Academic Writing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10FYBVZ3DKxYoBP_5MpfAekDnAsvxZRah?usp=sharing)                           |
|Assignment7    |Industrial Visit to eTiQa                               |An important turning point in my career development was my visit to eTiQa. My understanding of data engineering changed from theoretical to practical as a result of interacting with the staff, which also made clear the technical skills that top employers value. Hafizulshah Sharom, a UTM alumnus, inspired me greatly with his career path; his guidance has helped me better organise my own skill development. I came away from the session with a fresh emphasis on technical proficiency as well as the understanding that flexibility and lifelong learning are essential for success in this field.                              | [Newsletter](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MOXxi5cTMFS5Qk2eTFgOXRIiDkYWb_Cz?usp=sharing)                         |
 |Assignment8    |Design Thinking                            |Through this assignment, I engaged with the complete process of requirements engineering from eliciting public needs to conducting a comparative analysis of existing market solutions. These insights were directly applied to the creation of our prototype, ensuring the design was grounded in evidence and user utility. Furthermore, the project served as a practical exercise in team dynamics, reinforcing the necessity of clear communication and coordinated effort. I view this conceptual prototype as a strong foundation and look forward to the technical challenge of implementing and deploying a live version.                              | [Report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/122dNLQtfcDAordB9T22mzcGxn5y9eBlj?usp=sharing) [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZIGXUdSB-_OqnGIwESpud2qK99KBIGHM/view?usp=drivesdk)                        |
