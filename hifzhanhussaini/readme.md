|Assignment1     |  Industrial visit to UTM digital                             |My  friends  and  I  attended the UTMDigital Open Day, where  we  learned  about  innovative  technologies  being  used  in  industries  to  improve  productivity,  safety, and efficiency.  We  attended  an  excellent  presentation  from  Canon  and SK Leong that  highlighted Canon's new  SmartBoard and its life-saving fall  detection AI for patients in Singapore. The  technology  describes how automating repetitive tasks enables  people to focus on  the  more complex challenges in  life,  improving both productivity and quality of living. Overall, our visit to  UTMDigital  Open  Day  made  us  realize  the  importance  of  being  ethically  responsible  innovators and knowing  that in this rapidly changing digital world,  we  will  need  to  continue  to  adapt  and  embrace  lifelong  learning.                               |[Video](https://youtu.be/PAjjVExgFEk?si=a3Drw5Q34KhUTPh_)                              |
|Assignment2    |PC maintenance                               |My group took part in the PC Maintenance  Hands-On  Practical  that  involved  taking  apart  computers , including opening  up the cases  and  taking  out the fans  of  the  CPUs,. The  experience was invaluable  because  it  exposed  me  to the physical make  up of the computers.It  was  a great team-building  experience,  and I think an extended session would have allowed  for  exploration  of  more advanced troubleshooting techniques.  All  in  all, this  hands-on practical provided  me  with a well-rounded foundation in hardware, and I believe  that the skills  I  developed  will  last a long time.                               |  [Photo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sxAF2Jy8MLkwVBPpa2samHdWRAzLoTku?usp=drive_link)                           |
|Assignment3    |Industrial talk:Online Global Classroom                               |The talk gave me a much deeper perspective on building trust in intelligent systems through the integration of **AI, Cybersecurity, and Blockchain**. It was eye-opening to see how these fields must work together within ethical and transparent frameworks to ensure the systems we build are truly responsible. Since AI is now ubiquitous, it is critical to follow strict development guidelines and curb misuse in cyber-related crimes. This experience drove home the point that being a future data engineer isn't just about pure coding; it's about integrating governance and security into every infrastructure we build. While the session was insightful, adding hands-on labs in the future would be a great way to engage more directly with these concepts, reinforcing that responsible innovation is the only way to sustain public trust in technology.                               |[Photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HifEIDCSfv-eSk4Ba_m2T81vlsh2jfZC/view?usp=drive_link)                             |
