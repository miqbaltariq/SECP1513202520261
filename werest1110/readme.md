| Assignment 1   | Industry visit 1 (UTM Digital Day) |On 28th October 2025, my team and I had the opportunity to join the UTM Digital Open Day. Through this event, I gained a lot of valuable insight into AI in this century. The most unforgettable and amazing experience was the presentation by Mr. Ronald Chong from Canon Marketing, who spoke about how AI is changing the world, from healthcare to safety.After that, I was glad to interview the staff of the UTM Digital Department. From this interview, I gained deeper insights into the university's systems, such as e-learning and UTM Smart.Anyway, thank you for this opportunity!                                         | ![1766196951805](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1752e8aa-042c-44c0-bfe0-58e0e60ac1e2)
|Assignment 2 | PC Assemble Lab | It is funnn! I'm so glad to have this oppornity to join the lab. It's such a great feeling when my perspective shifts. It is beacause I finally know how to assemble the PC and see how the computer component look likes such as power supply, RAM card, as well as the connection between each wire and machine.    |![photo_2025-12-30_16-17-30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e10d8ea-f172-48ff-8d42-9bc7df1acf52)
|Assignment 3 | Industry talk 1 | From this talk, I learned that PPG is an invisible giant that touches our daily lives  from soda cans to airplanes. It was cool to see how they use a "Plan, Build, Run" model to keep their global operations moving as they shift toward a "Cloud-only" future. Moreover, the presenters also remind us via the real-world reality by explaining that school projects are only using clean data,  but the industry deals with massive, messy datasets that require serious and stable SQL and database skills. After finishing the assignment, I would like to pay affort start now instead of struggle during my final year project. |![photo_2025-12-30_16-49-43](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe79e82d-8f4e-4fdb-a76e-3769145ad7be)
|Assignment 4 | Industry talk 2 |First and foremost, the industry talks really shift my perspective on how to success in computer science. I see that being successful is not only about technical skills, but also communication. The speaker pointed out that choosing between the Waterfall and Agile is like how we plan our lifestyle. So, I had to plan carefully and stay calm when unexpected problems came toward me. In the next four years, I will focus on improving my coding skills at the same time, also strengthening my communication, teamwork, as well as problem-solving abilities. By combining these characteristics, I believe that I can better connect my work to real world applications and work effectively with others, which is vital for success in computer science  | <img width="595" height="436" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-30 170830" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04f08033-ddff-4485-803c-ad3db46164c6" />
|Assignment 5 | Industry visit 2 | On 15th Jan 2026, our team had the opportunity to visit EqiQa, a subsidiary of Malayan Banking Berhad(MAYBANK). This visit really provided me a clear and straight roadmap for success in my course. Also, I now realize that SQL and Python are essential skills to master during university life and even in my future career. Moreover, we have to be positive and confident as the things we do are not useless. As a data student, we have to ensure that the data passing is clean and correct to prevent mistakes. Furthermore, I gained some valuable insight into working environment and specific requirements needed to enter this field. |![photo_2026-02-13_00-23-31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10de8fff-7e8d-4a10-b8b8-3f18f45da118)
|Assignment 6 | Design Thinking | Firstly, majority of the people including me will think that communication and teamwork is only the vital things to finish a project. But after this Design Thinking program, I learned that there are many phases involved in doing a project such as empathy, define, ideate and so on. On Empathy and Define phase, I learned that it is important to find the problem from the user's perspective before jumping to solutions. This allows us target the issues easily and accurately and save time. Besides, following this framework allows our team to work easily and effectively. Finally, in the Ideate phase, I discovered a critical element, *Innovation**, which can showcase our team's creativity and uniqueness.|![photo_2026-02-13_00-56-41](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51924e83-273d-4c78-9b3f-5129a7736807)
