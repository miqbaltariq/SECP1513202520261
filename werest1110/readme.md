| Assignment 1   | Industry visit 1 (UTM Digital Day) |On 28th October 2025, my team and I had the opportunity to join the UTM Digital Open Day. Through this event, I gained a lot of valuable insight into AI in this century. The most unforgettable and amazing experience was the presentation by Mr. Ronald Chong from Canon Marketing, who spoke about how AI is changing the world, from healthcare to safety.After that, I was glad to interview the staff of the UTM Digital Department. From this interview, I gained deeper insights into the university's systems, such as e-learning and UTM Smart.Anyway, thank you for this opportunity!| ![1766196951805](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1752e8aa-042c-44c0-bfe0-58e0e60ac1e2)

|Assignment 3 | Industry talk 1 | |
|Assignment 4 | Industry talk 2 |First and foremost, the industry talks really shift my perspective on how to success in computer science. I see that being successful is not only about technical skills, but also communication. The speaker pointed out that choosing between the Waterfall and Agile is like how we plan our lifestyle. So, I had to plan carefully and stay calm when unexpected problems came toward me. In the next four years, I will focus on improving my coding skills at the same time, also strengthening my communication, teamwork, as well as problem-solving abilities. By combining these characteristics, I believe that I can better connect my work to real world applications and work effectively with others, which is vital for success in computer science  | g
