|2|Lab 1 (PC Assemble)|Through this lab activity, I learned how to disassemble hardware components inside a PC such as the RAM, CPU fan, cables, hard disk drive, and so on. After that, we needed to assemble the hardware components again and make sure everything worked correctly since we had to perform a power-on test for our lecturer. This experience taught me how to identify hardware components and where they should be installed. In the future, I am confident that I can assemble my own PC based on my requirements because it is more cost-effective, and having hands-on experience will be very enjoyable.|![Image1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/010f982a-0744-43e7-8996-985affc4c646)
