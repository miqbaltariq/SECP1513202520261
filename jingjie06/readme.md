|2|Lab 1 (PC Assemble)|Through this lab activity, I learned how to disassemble hardware components inside a PC such as the RAM, CPU fan, cables, hard disk drive, and so on. After that, we needed to assemble the hardware components again and make sure everything worked correctly since we had to perform a power-on test for our lecturer. This experience taught me how to identify hardware components and where they should be installed. In the future, I am confident that I can assemble my own PC based on my requirements because it is more cost-effective, and having hands-on experience will be very enjoyable.|![Image1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/010f982a-0744-43e7-8996-985affc4c646)
|3|Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom|Attending this online talk gave me valuable insights into how AI is transforming cybersecurity, digital systems, and society as a whole. I learned that AI can improve threat detection by analyzing data in real time. Overall, AI is advancing rapidly, so we need to stay up to date with the era to avoid being left behind.|![WhatsApp Image 2025-11-13 at 20 16 31_4aafbc8e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ffc19ca-79dd-4585-b1ce-2052f7b8beaf)|
|4|Industry Talk 1 by PPG|The PPG industry talk gave me a clear understanding of how ICT drives business operations in large companies. I learned the importance of programmers in managing data, as they help the company clean massive and complex datasets and transform them to enable data-driven decision making. In the future, I will enhance my knowledge of programming languages, analysis tools, and AI-driven IT operations to help companies interact more effectively with their data.|![WhatsApp Image 2025-11-25 at 16 57 42_bb510381](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92424d58-41e2-463b-9745-e874b4bb73fb)<br>[View Poster](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd3128c9-0588-4887-99e2-800e09568bec)|
|5|ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025|The ASEAN Quantum Summit was a great experience that showed me the power of deep-tech like Quantum Computing and AI. I learned that countries like Japan, Singapore, and those in ASEAN are working together to build a strong ecosystem for these new technologies. It was interesting to see how quantum technology is not just a classroom idea but something that can work with super-computing and data pipelines to solve real-world problems. The talk also showed how these technologies are being used in Johor’s development and smart city initiatives. Overall, this summit motivated me to stay curious and keep learning about advanced systems so I can be ready for the future of the technology industry.|![photo_2025-12-13_19-26-01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee4a5c3-05af-43c9-b9af-f3532cd5cab0)<br>![photo_2025-12-13_21-33-44](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6c2a5f1-2258-4438-a3e3-9ba40eae3ef1)|
|6|Industry Talk 2 by Serunai|From this industry talk, I learned about the skills required as a computer science student, and the speaker taught us that we should not just focus on the coding aspect. First of all, to become a successful computer science student, we must also develop and strengthen our soft skills to help us adapt and stay competitive with others. For now, I will try to improve my soft skills at the same time, such as communication, collaboration, and teamwork. Also, I will try to gain knowledge outside of textbooks so I can quickly adapt to the evolution of the world and always be prepared. I believe that with consistency and determination, learning can help me keep moving forward and become a successful graduate.|[View Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vY-r7sv-n8cGZU1Juf4K-yvhtDwIa8-p/view?usp=sharing)|
|7|Industry Visit 2(EtiQa)|The industrial visit to Etiqa Insurance and Takaful was an eye-opening experience that showed me how data engineering and AI are used in the insurance sector. I learned how integrated systems manage millions of transactions for policy management, claims processing, and risk assessment while keeping data secure.A standout example was how Etiqa uses AI profiling to detect flood areas and automatically credit insurance claims to victims, such as during the Selangor floods. This showed me that technical skills like SQL and Python are much more powerful when used to solve real-world problems. I also gained a better understanding of how different teams—like data engineers, data analysts, and business analysts—must collaborate and communicate effectively to align technology with business needs. Overall, this visit taught me that being a successful professional requires a mix of technical expertise, teamwork, and a passion for creating impactful digital solutions.|[View NEWSLETTER](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vY-r7sv-n8cGZU1Juf4K-yvhtDwIa8-p/view?usp=sharing)<br>![WhatsApp Image 2026-01-15 at 4 51 21 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/713be79a-7ec3-43d1-93db-28d23c541eef)
|8|Design Thinking Project|This Design Thinking project taught me that successful technology starts with understanding people's problems, not just writing code. By following the stages of Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test, I learned how to turn real-world needs into a practical digital solution.The project showed me that solving problems is a process that requires constant brainstorming, teamwork, and user feedback. This experience has motivated me to improve both my technical and communication skills so I can build useful, user-centered systems in my future career.|[View Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DvT1q_XwokzVTts0LUEXTMyOHEacrazx/view?usp=sharing)<br>[View Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1402PlvdiA134xlzf35xmo26nLL4BXux3/view?usp=drivesdk)|
