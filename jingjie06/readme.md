| 1 | Industry Visit 1|Attending the UTM Digital Talk and UTMDigital Open Day really helped me realise how important AI, digital tools, and data systems are in shaping modern education and campus management. The sessions showed how technology can create more interactive learning environments and improve efficiency in facilities management. This experience motivated me to be more open to digital innovation and better prepared for a technology-driven future.|[Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bFIVbgYPNPTbdoVyjteMnKj8Ujo4IAG6/view)|
|2|Lab 1 (PC Assemble)|Through this lab activity, I learned how to disassemble hardware components inside a PC such as the RAM, CPU fan, cables, hard disk drive, and so on. After that, we needed to assemble the hardware components again and make sure everything worked correctly since we had to perform a power-on test for our lecturer. This experience taught me how to identify hardware components and where they should be installed. In the future, I am confident that I can assemble my own PC based on my requirements because it is more cost-effective, and having hands-on experience will be very enjoyable.|
|3|Industry Talk: Online Global Classroom|Attending this online talk gave me valuable insights into how AI is transforming cybersecurity, digital systems, and society as a whole. I learned that AI can improve threat detection by analyzing data in real time. Overall, AI is advancing rapidly, so we need to stay up to date with the era to avoid being left behind.|picture|
|4|Industry Talk 1:PPG|The PPG industry talk gave me a clear understanding of how ICT drives business operations in large companies. I learned the importance of programmers in managing data, as they help the company clean massive and complex datasets and transform them to enable data-driven decision making. In the future, I will enhance my knowledge of programming languages, analysis tools, and AI-driven IT operations to help companies interact more effectively with their data.|picture|
