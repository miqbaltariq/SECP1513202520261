| Assignment 1    | Industry Visit 1 (UTM Digital) Assesment: Video|  ![WhatsApp Image 2025-11-07 at 11 30 18_0aee2bac](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e698316-6312-474e-98e0-a9c7bb3a5c0c) https://youtu.be/rIJXn1I24hk|  It was an insightful experience where I got to explore the latest technology updates from industry leaders like Microsoft, Dell, and Oracle. The "DigitechX" sharing sessions were particularly eye-opening, especially the topics on AI and cybersecurity which showed how fast the industry is moving. This event really helped bridge the gap between my studies and the real digital world, motivating me to keep up with these rapid tech advancements.  |

It was a satisfying experience to build a system from scratch, ensuring that every component from the processor to the power supply was correctly seated and connected. This session reminded me that while software drives the world, understanding the hardware foundation is equally critical for troubleshooting and optimizing system performance in the real world.     |
