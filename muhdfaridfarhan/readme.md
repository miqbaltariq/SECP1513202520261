| Assignment 1    | Industry Visit 1 (UTM Digital) Assesment: Video ![WhatsApp Image 2025-12-28 at 15 25 15_b29ec278](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c367d333-0e5c-4bd3-ba4b-dea27ab39bc6) |  ![WhatsApp Image 2025-11-07 at 11 30 18_0aee2bac](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e698316-6312-474e-98e0-a9c7bb3a5c0c) https://youtu.be/rIJXn1I24hk|  It was an insightful experience where I got to explore the latest technology updates from industry leaders like Microsoft, Dell, and Oracle. The "DigitechX" sharing sessions were particularly eye-opening, especially the topics on AI and cybersecurity which showed how fast the industry is moving. This event really helped bridge the gap between my studies and the real digital world, motivating me to keep up with these rapid tech advancements.  |
| Lab    | PC Assemble    | <img width="1280" height="1707" alt="530047521-127d49cd-2ea6-42b3-b2d7-d4ff64d84049" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53073ab5-9b05-4047-9dc1-14885164e822" />| Participating in the PC assembly session was a great opportunity to refresh my technical skills and see the latest hardware up close. It was a satisfying experience to build a system from scratch, ensuring that every component from the processor to the power supply was correctly seated and connected. This session reminded me that while software drives the world, understanding the hardware foundation is equally critical for troubleshooting and optimizing system performance in the real world.     |
| Industry Talk    | Online Global Classroomn <img width="747" height="1060" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51d4ac76-095b-4d31-9544-5bfd7489a81e" /> | <img width="1280" height="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92caf1e8-0118-4309-9156-c8144d447783" /> | After fun sessions with all the speakers, I could conclude that eventhough the development of AI can brings a lot of benefits to humans, it can also become a serious threat if not developed correctly. Irresponsible individuals may use the AI to cause harm such as hacking and also developed the AI to spread biased information. Meaning that, in order to create trust and ethics in AI, developers must develop AI with responsible so that it can be reliable for all people. Hoping that I could involve in a similar programs which can expand my knowledge about AI as it is one of my main interest in Information Technology.    |
| Event   | ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 <img width="1280" height="703" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ed9ba98-bb53-4e72-81b4-d81ef8aab9de" />| <img width="960" height="1280" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c06c980b-f256-4507-8993-5408a8b80915" /> <img width="1280" height="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/020da574-3d90-45ac-a59e-97a30d16c425" /> | The ASEAN Quantum Summit gave me a clearer understanding of how quantum technology is developing and why regional cooperation is important. Hearing experts discuss real applications such as cybersecurity and communication which helped me a lot see its impact on the future. Overall, the summit inspired me to stay interested in this fast-growing field.|

Hearing about his work with blockchain at Serunai Commerce showed me that computer science is about solving real problems, not just coding. To succeed in the future, I plan to focus on "continuous learning." I will first master important basics like data structures because they help me learn new things easily, and I will practice these skills by working on projects on GitHub. Since technology changes quickly, I will also keep learning new areas like AI and cloud computing to stay updated. finally, I will improve my soft skills by joining team competitions, ensuring I have both the technical knowledge and teamwork abilities to become a successful professional.     |
