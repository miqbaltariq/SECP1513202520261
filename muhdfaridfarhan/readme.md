| Assignment 1    | Industry Visit 1 (UTM Digital) Assesment: Video|  ![WhatsApp Image 2025-11-07 at 11 30 18_0aee2bac](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e698316-6312-474e-98e0-a9c7bb3a5c0c) https://youtu.be/rIJXn1I24hk|  It was an insightful experience where I got to explore the latest technology updates from industry leaders like Microsoft, Dell, and Oracle. The "DigitechX" sharing sessions were particularly eye-opening, especially the topics on AI and cybersecurity which showed how fast the industry is moving. This event really helped bridge the gap between my studies and the real digital world, motivating me to keep up with these rapid tech advancements.  |
| Assignment 2    | PC Assemble    | <img width="1280" height="1707" alt="530047521-127d49cd-2ea6-42b3-b2d7-d4ff64d84049" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53073ab5-9b05-4047-9dc1-14885164e822" />| Participating in the PC assembly session was a great opportunity to refresh my technical skills and see the latest hardware up close. It was a satisfying experience to build a system from scratch, ensuring that every component from the processor to the power supply was correctly seated and connected. This session reminded me that while software drives the world, understanding the hardware foundation is equally critical for troubleshooting and optimizing system performance in the real world.     |
| Assignment 3    | Industry Talk 1 by PPG| ![WhatsApp Image 2025-12-28 at 14 01 07_6e699586](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66f958f1-cbb8-4c8f-a81d-23d31b71252b)  | I was really inspired by the company’s focus on growth and mentorship. It was encouraging to hear that their internship program has a high conversion rate to permanent roles, proving that they value talent and practical effort. The speakers emphasized that while academic results matter, attitude and the willingness to learn new technologies are just as important for a successful career. This session gave me a clear goal: to build not just my grades, but also my soft skills and practical project experience.    |
