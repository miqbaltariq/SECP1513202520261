# REFLECTIVE JOURNAL - DATA ENGINEERING PROGRAMME

---

| NO. | EVENTS | DATE | DESCRIPTION | REFLECTION (MY PERSPECTIVE) |
|-----|--------|------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 1. | UTM Digital Open Day | 28 August 2025 | Gathered in front of UTM Digital led by Sir Iqbal. Gained insights on digital applications in daily life. The most interesting booth featured a company that develops built-in systems and apps for businesses to track electrical usage in specific areas, with automatic control for lights and air conditioners to optimize electricity savings. Also conducted an interview with one of the UTM Digital staff. | This experience opened my eyes to how digital solutions are not just about software but also about integrating hardware for real-world efficiency. The smart energy management system inspired me to think about sustainability in tech. Interviewing the staff gave me a clearer picture of how digital transformation is implemented at the university level. I realized that even small optimizations in electricity usage can lead to significant cost savings and environmental benefits. |
| 2. | PC Maintenance Session | 18 October 2025 | Participated in a hands-on learning session where we physically interacted with PC hardware. Learned to disassemble PC components, identify each part's function, and reassemble them. Each group was required to successfully boot up the PC. Smooth operation qualified us as ready for the PC maintenance quiz. | This was my first time touching actual PC components, and I initially felt nervous about damaging something. However, the systematic approach taught me that hardware is logical and repairable. Successfully booting the PC gave me a sense of accomplishment. I now understand the importance of hardware knowledge even as a data-focused student because troubleshooting becomes easier when you understand the machine's physical layer. |
| 3. | Online Global Classroom | 18 November 2025 | Attended an online talk featuring lectures from various universities including Dubai. Topics covered Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, the synergy of Blockchain, and AI Ethics. Speakers emphasized the growing importance of AI across all industries. | The session made me realize that AI is no longer optional—it is becoming mandatory across sectors. The discussion on AI Ethics particularly stood out because technology without ethics can cause harm. I also found the synergy between Blockchain and AI fascinating, especially in terms of data integrity and security. This motivated me to explore how data engineers play a role in ensuring AI systems are fair and transparent. |
| 4. | PPG Industry Talk | 20 November 2025 | Learned about the workflow and operations of a large coating company. Realized how massive amounts of data are managed even in industries not typically associated with tech. PPG was also introduced as our panel company for the one-year internship programme. | This talk shattered my assumption that only tech companies handle big data. PPG showed me that manufacturing and coating industries rely heavily on data for quality control, inventory, and supply chain. It made me appreciate how data engineering is applicable everywhere. Knowing PPG is our internship panel also motivated me to prepare myself professionally. |
| 5. | ASEAN Quantum Summit | 11 December 2025 | Attended a talk on quantum computing delivered by a professor from the University of Osaka. The session covered the fundamentals and potential applications of quantum in computing. | Honestly, quantum computing felt intimidating at first. However, the professor explained it in a way that made complex concepts digestible. I learned that quantum computing is not just about speed but about solving problems classical computers cannot solve. Although it is still emerging, I believe understanding quantum basics will be an advantage in the near future. |
| 6. | Serunai Industry Talk | 18 December 2025 | A talk delivered by our data engineering senior. He revealed the real workflow in data engineering working environments, explained how the Waterfall model is applied in projects, and introduced the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). | Hearing from a senior was very relatable. He did not just talk about theories but shared real experiences including challenges faced during projects. The explanation of SDLC gave me a structured view of how data projects move from planning to deployment. I now see why requirements gathering and documentation are so critical. |
| 7. | Etiqa Industry Visit | 15 January 2026 | Visited the Etiqa office and gained detailed insights into how an insurance company manages massive amounts of data. Learned about their data security measures in handling clients' personal information professionally and efficiently. | This visit highlighted the weight of responsibility in handling sensitive data. I used to think data engineering was only about building pipelines, but at Etiqa, I saw how security and privacy are embedded in every layer. It made me reflect on the importance of ethics in our profession. The professionalism of their team set a standard I aspire to reach. |
| 8. | Design Thinking Project (Aquatic Centre) | January 2026 | My team designed a system for UTM swimming pools. Features included: online booking system (to solve overcrowding since pools became free), real-time availability of swimming caps for rent, live camera feed to check crowd levels, queue system for song playlists, and fitness app sync with weekly leaderboards to encourage healthy competition. | This project taught me that technology must solve real human problems. Our interviews revealed that the free entry policy caused booking chaos and long waiting times. We didn't just build features randomly—each one addressed a specific pain point. The song queue and fitness leaderboard features added an element of community and fun. I learned that user empathy is just as important as technical skills. |
